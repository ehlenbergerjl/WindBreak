# Assignment 2:
Before you turn this problem in, make sure everything runs as expected. First, **restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\rightarrow$Run All).

Make sure you fill in any place that says `YOUR CODE HERE` or "YOUR ANSWER HERE", as well as your name and collaborators below:

1) Create zonal statistics (basically the whole step) for these datasets:   
counties_subset_Albers4.shp   
crop_cover_2019.tif
2) In the zonal statistics, only include these crops: 1, 5, 6, 23, 24, 26, 225,226, 236, 237, 238, 240, 241, 254.
3) From the zonal stat table, delete column "sum".
4) What is the unit of the zonal statistics result?

What does the crop_2018_subset represent:   
- 1:Corn
- 5:Soybeans
- 6:Sunflower
- 23:Spring Wheat
- 24:Winter Wheat
- 26:Dbl Crop WinWht/Soybeans   
- 225:Dbl Crop WinWht/Corn
- 226:Dbl Crop Oats/Corn
- 236:Dbl Cropp WinWht/Sorghum
- 237:Dbl Crop Barley/Corn   
- 238:Dbl Crop WinWht/Cotten
- 240:Dbl Crop Soybeans/Oats
- 241:bl Crop Corn/Soybeans
- 254: Dbl Crop Barley/Soybeans

To inlcude: 1, 5, 6, 23, 24, 26, 225,226, 236, 237, 238, 240, 241, 254
