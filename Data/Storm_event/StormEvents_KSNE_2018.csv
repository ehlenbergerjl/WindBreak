These bands rotated cyclonically, expanded and eventually merged with the larger snow band to the west which finally began moving east after midnight. By daybreak Monday, one large snow band extended from south central Nebraska into southern Minnesota. Over central Nebraska, the snow was heaviest and most persistent along and north of Highway 92, from 3 am to 9 am CST. At least 10 inches of snow fell over most of that area. The highest amounts were 14 inches at Belgrade and St. Paul. Greeley measured 12 inches, with 11 inches at Genoa, Osceola, and Shelby, and 10 inches at Ord. Other amounts of note include 7 inches at Grand Island and Ravenna.

The vast majority of 2+ amounts focused southwest of a line from Loup City-Grand Island-Clay Center-Hebron. According to reports from NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS and official NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 5 at Red Cloud, 4 at Hubbell, 3.9 at Hebron and also four miles southwest of Blue Hill, and 3.8 eight miles south of Elwood.

Speaking of forcing, this event was driven by a classic case of pronounced mid-level frontogenesis, trailing well-behind a strong surface cold front that passed through during the preceding 24 hours.

Interestingly, the two snow events overlapped minimally in area, with the first round focused mainly within northern and central counties, and the second one across the south. This event summary discusses round 1, which occurred between the afternoon of the 9th and the pre-dawn hours of the 10th:||This first round of snow primarily affected areas north of Highway 6, and especially counties along and north of Interstate 80, which reported a fairly widespread coverage of 2-4 and isolated higher amounts to around 5. According to reports from NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS and official NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 5 northwest of Greeley, 4.7 west of Arcadia, 4.2 at Grand Island airport and 3.6 at Ravenna. Other official Tri Cities totals included 2.3 at Kearney and only 1.7 at the Hastings NWS office. Although not overly-strong, sustained north winds averaged 10-20 MPH with some higher gusts, causing at least minor blowing and drifting of the fluffy snow. Timing-wise, while some northern counties received minor accumulation early in the afternoon of the 9th, the primary west-east oriented snow band got going in the north between 4-6 PM before gradually slipping southward across the Interstate 80 corridor through the evening. Between midnight and 2 AM on the 10th, this snow band weakened and shifted east of the local area, signaling the end of round 1. Aloft, a large-scale, broad trough was in place over much of the United States with a series of jet streaks passing directly over Nebraska. This setup yielded a concentrated swath of mid-level frontogenesis, which in turn promoted the rather narrow, west-east oriented snow band that dropped the majority of accumulation. At the surface, the fluffy nature of the flakes was supported by a very cold airmass with temperatures only in the single digits above zero F. The breezy north winds resulted from steady pressure rises emanating southward across the Central Plains from high pressure in Montana and the Dakotas.",A snowfall total of 2.7 inches occurred in St. Paul.,CSV

Interestingly, the two snow events overlapped minimally in area, with the first round focused mainly within northern and central counties, and the second one across the south. This event summary discusses round 1, which occurred between the afternoon of the 9th and the pre-dawn hours of the 10th:||This first round of snow primarily affected areas north of Highway 6, and especially counties along and north of Interstate 80, which reported a fairly widespread coverage of 2-4 and isolated higher amounts to around 5. According to reports from NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS and official NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 5 northwest of Greeley, 4.7 west of Arcadia, 4.2 at Grand Island airport and 3.6 at Ravenna. Other official Tri Cities totals included 2.3 at Kearney and only 1.7 at the Hastings NWS office. Although not overly-strong, sustained north winds averaged 10-20 MPH with some higher gusts, causing at least minor blowing and drifting of the fluffy snow. Timing-wise, while some northern counties received minor accumulation early in the afternoon of the 9th, the primary west-east oriented snow band got going in the north between 4-6 PM before gradually slipping southward across the Interstate 80 corridor through the evening. Between midnight and 2 AM on the 10th, this snow band weakened and shifted east of the local area, signaling the end of round 1. Aloft, a large-scale, broad trough was in place over much of the United States with a series of jet streaks passing directly over Nebraska. This setup yielded a concentrated swath of mid-level frontogenesis, which in turn promoted the rather narrow, west-east oriented snow band that dropped the majority of accumulation. At the surface, the fluffy nature of the flakes was supported by a very cold airmass with temperatures only in the single digits above zero F. The breezy north winds resulted from steady pressure rises emanating southward across the Central Plains from high pressure in Montana and the Dakotas.","A snowfall total of 3.5 inches occurred 2 miles southwest of Genoa, and a total of 2.0 inches fell in Belgrade.",CSV

The vast majority of 2+ amounts focused southwest of a line from Loup City-Grand Island-Clay Center-Hebron. According to reports from NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS and official NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 5 at Red Cloud, 4 at Hubbell, 3.9 at Hebron and also four miles southwest of Blue Hill, and 3.8 eight miles south of Elwood. In the Nebraska Tri Cities, totals included: 1.7 at Grand Island airport, 2.6 at Hastings NWS and 2.9 at Kearney airport. Although even the higher-end totals were relatively modest, this event packed somewhat of a punch given sustained north winds generally 20-25 MPH/gusts 30+ MPH, resulting in some drifting and at least brief visibility reductions to one-half mile or less. ||As for timing, the vast majority of accumulating snow fell between 3-10 AM, gradually ending from north-to-south as forcing departed southward into Kansas. Speaking of forcing, this event was driven by a classic case of pronounced mid-level frontogenesis, trailing well-behind a strong surface cold front that passed through during the preceding 24 hours. On the larger scale, a broad shortwave trough tracked southeast from the Northern Rockies/Dakotas into the Midwest over the course of Feb. 4th. Locally, this snow event was accompanied by a very cold airmass featuring surface temperatures only in the single digits above zero F, and wind chill values ranging from -10 to -20 F.","A snowfall total of 4.0 inches occurred in Hubbell, and also, 3.9 inches fell in Hebron.",CSV

Between midnight and 6 AM CST Monday, an occluded front swept across south central Nebraska. During the day Monday, several lows consolidated into a primary low along the South Dakota-Minnesota border. This low became nearly stationary as the fronts continued to progress far to the east and south. Monday night this low performed a loop and moved southeast into Iowa. During the day Tuesday, this low rapidly filled and became absorbed into a low over the Great Lakes. Two periods of strong winds occurred. The first occurred from midday through the afternoon hours Monday due to diurnal mixing. Widespread wind gusts of 50 to 61 mph occurred mainly along and west of Highway 281. There were a couple mesonet sites that measured 64 mph near Kearney and 69 mph near Norman, although these stations may not necessarily be sited properly. From the official stations, the highest winds were measured at Lexington where winds were sustained at or above 40 mph for five hours with a peak gust of 61 mph. The high winds combined with dry fuels and relative humidity levels as low as 23% to create favorable conditions for the wildfire that occurred near Wilsonville. There was a lull over much of the area during the evening, then winds increased again. The second period of high winds occurred between midnight and 9 AM CST on Tuesday. These winds were associated with a tightening of the pressure gradient as the low performed its loop. This also induced steepening lapse rates associated with an increase in cold air advection. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 68 mph occurred. The highest wind gusts from official stations included 66 mph at the airport in Hastings and 65 mph at the Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island. The highest unofficial gust was 68 mph near Norman.",A wind gust of 62 MPH was measured by the Ord Airport ASOS.,CSV

Damage from the tornadoes was minimal, however, significant damage occurred due to the very large hail.",The Kansas Highway Patrol reported that a semi had jack knifed on Interstate 70 due to the strong winds.,CSV

The vast majority of 2+ amounts focused southwest of a line from Loup City-Grand Island-Clay Center-Hebron. According to reports from NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS and official NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 5 at Red Cloud, 4 at Hubbell, 3.9 at Hebron and also four miles southwest of Blue Hill, and 3.8 eight miles south of Elwood. In the Nebraska Tri Cities, totals included: 1.7 at Grand Island airport, 2.6 at Hastings NWS and 2.9 at Kearney airport. Although even the higher-end totals were relatively modest, this event packed somewhat of a punch given sustained north winds generally 20-25 MPH/gusts 30+ MPH, resulting in some drifting and at least brief visibility reductions to one-half mile or less. ||As for timing, the vast majority of accumulating snow fell between 3-10 AM, gradually ending from north-to-south as forcing departed southward into Kansas. Speaking of forcing, this event was driven by a classic case of pronounced mid-level frontogenesis, trailing well-behind a strong surface cold front that passed through during the preceding 24 hours. On the larger scale, a broad shortwave trough tracked southeast from the Northern Rockies/Dakotas into the Midwest over the course of Feb. 4th. Locally, this snow event was accompanied by a very cold airmass featuring surface temperatures only in the single digits above zero F, and wind chill values ranging from -10 to -20 F.",A snowfall total of 3.0 inches occurred in Franklin.,CSV

Between midnight and 6 AM CST Monday, an occluded front swept across south central Nebraska. During the day Monday, several lows consolidated into a primary low along the South Dakota-Minnesota border. This low became nearly stationary as the fronts continued to progress far to the east and south. Monday night this low performed a loop and moved southeast into Iowa. During the day Tuesday, this low rapidly filled and became absorbed into a low over the Great Lakes. Two periods of strong winds occurred. The first occurred from midday through the afternoon hours Monday due to diurnal mixing. Widespread wind gusts of 50 to 61 mph occurred mainly along and west of Highway 281. There were a couple mesonet sites that measured 64 mph near Kearney and 69 mph near Norman, although these stations may not necessarily be sited properly. From the official stations, the highest winds were measured at Lexington where winds were sustained at or above 40 mph for five hours with a peak gust of 61 mph. The high winds combined with dry fuels and relative humidity levels as low as 23% to create favorable conditions for the wildfire that occurred near Wilsonville.

During the day Monday, several lows consolidated into a primary low along the South Dakota-Minnesota border. This low became nearly stationary as the fronts continued to progress far to the east and south. Monday night this low performed a loop and moved southeast into Iowa. During the day Tuesday, this low rapidly filled and became absorbed into a low over the Great Lakes. Two periods of strong winds occurred. The first occurred from midday through the afternoon hours Monday due to diurnal mixing. Widespread wind gusts of 50 to 61 mph occurred mainly along and west of Highway 281. There were a couple mesonet sites that measured 64 mph near Kearney and 69 mph near Norman, although these stations may not necessarily be sited properly. From the official stations, the highest winds were measured at Lexington where winds were sustained at or above 40 mph for five hours with a peak gust of 61 mph. The high winds combined with dry fuels and relative humidity levels as low as 23% to create favorable conditions for the wildfire that occurred near Wilsonville. There was a lull over much of the area during the evening, then winds increased again. The second period of high winds occurred between midnight and 9 AM CST on Tuesday. These winds were associated with a tightening of the pressure gradient as the low performed its loop. This also induced steepening lapse rates associated with an increase in cold air advection. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 68 mph occurred.

The vast majority of 2+ amounts focused southwest of a line from Loup City-Grand Island-Clay Center-Hebron. According to reports from NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS and official NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 5 at Red Cloud, 4 at Hubbell, 3.9 at Hebron and also four miles southwest of Blue Hill, and 3.8 eight miles south of Elwood. In the Nebraska Tri Cities, totals included: 1.7 at Grand Island airport, 2.6 at Hastings NWS and 2.9 at Kearney airport. Although even the higher-end totals were relatively modest, this event packed somewhat of a punch given sustained north winds generally 20-25 MPH/gusts 30+ MPH, resulting in some drifting and at least brief visibility reductions to one-half mile or less. ||As for timing, the vast majority of accumulating snow fell between 3-10 AM, gradually ending from north-to-south as forcing departed southward into Kansas. Speaking of forcing, this event was driven by a classic case of pronounced mid-level frontogenesis, trailing well-behind a strong surface cold front that passed through during the preceding 24 hours. On the larger scale, a broad shortwave trough tracked southeast from the Northern Rockies/Dakotas into the Midwest over the course of Feb. 4th. Locally, this snow event was accompanied by a very cold airmass featuring surface temperatures only in the single digits above zero F, and wind chill values ranging from -10 to -20 F.","A snowfall total of 5.0 inches occurred in Red Cloud.

On both days, primarily the afternoon featured several hours of sustained speeds commonly 25-35 MPH (isolated 40 MPH) and frequent gusts to around 50 MPH, along with isolated severe-criteria gusts of 58+ MPH. Also on both days, the combination of recent dry conditions and recently-tilled fields promoted a number of localized dust storms, causing drastic visibility reductions over short distances. Specifically on the late afternoon of the 29th, dust blowing across Interstate 80 near the Aurora exit led to a major pileup of 29 vehicles, closing I-80 for over two hours. Sadly, this incident resulted in one fatality and over a dozen injuries. ||As for measured winds from a variety of official and unofficial sources, a few peak gusts on the 29th featured: 62 MPH near Kearney (mesonet), 59 MPH near Oxford (mesonet), and 58 MPH at Grand Island and Ord airports. At Kearney Regional Airport, sustained winds averaged 40 MPH for an hour, mainly between 12-1 PM CDT. Although it remained quite breezy even after dark, gusts by late evening largely eased below 40 MPH. Turning to the meteorological background, this was a classic recipe for prolonged, strong south winds across the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, an expansive, large-scale trough gradually deepened over the western CONUS, only edging slowly eastward. This in turn promoted strengthening surface low pressure across the Central High Plains, averaging around 998 millibars in eastern Colorado. This low pressure, in concert with sprawling high pressure centered over the eastern CONUS, set up a healthy pressure gradient.

Also on both days, the combination of recent dry conditions and recently-tilled fields promoted a number of localized dust storms, causing drastic visibility reductions over short distances.

Sadly, this incident resulted in one fatality and over a dozen injuries. ||As for measured winds from a variety of official and unofficial sources, a few peak gusts on the 29th featured: 62 MPH near Kearney (mesonet), 59 MPH near Oxford (mesonet), and 58 MPH at Grand Island and Ord airports.

There were several reports of large hail (up to baseball size), damaging winds (up to around 70 MPH), a few pockets of very heavy rainfall into mainly the 3-5 range, and one brief EF-0 tornado. This tornado, which exhibited multi-vortex structure along its short path, was caught on video by a storm chaser near Huntley in eastern Harlan County around 5:45 p.m. CDT. Shortly before dropping the tornado, this high-precipitation (HP) supercell storm also yielded tennis ball to baseball size hail several miles north of Orleans. Other notable hail reports on this day included 2 diameter stones near Franklin and ping pong ball size near Blue Hill. As for damaging winds, the highest measured gusts (unofficial sources) featured 71 MPH near Carleton and 63 MPH near Holbrook. At least minor tree/branch damage was reported in or near Cambridge and Naponee, and power lines were blown down near Republican City. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the 24-county area received at least 1 of mostly-welcomed rainfall. However, there were generally four distinct zones that got drenched with noticeably higher amounts of at least 3-4, and locally more. These included portions of the following counties: much of southern/eastern Thayer; much of northern Furnas and adjacent portions of Gosper/Phelps/Harlan; parts of northern Nuckolls/southern Clay; and parts of northeastern York. A few of the highest official 24-hour totals (NWS coop and CoCoRaHS observers) featured: 5.14 northeast of Chester, 4.52 near Deweese, 3.86 in Edison and 3.80 in Hubbell. There was also an unofficial report of a whopping 7 south of Gilead in far southeast Thayer County. Although there were surely several instances of fairly minor flooding and even brief flash flooding, ground truth reports were rather limited. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing, the first strong to severe storms of the afternoon fired up between 3:30-5:00 p.m. CDT on opposite ends of the local area, with one cluster in Thayer County and the other centered over Furnas County. During the next couple hours, intense multicell convection gradually connected the gap between the original two clusters, eventually resulting in one semi-organized band. However, during this same time, the most intense storm of the day took center stage as an embedded HP supercell tracked across much of Harlan and southern Franklin counties, producing very large hail and the aforementioned brief tornado. Between 7 p.m. CDT and nightfall, convection expanded in areal coverage to encompass most all of South Central Nebraska, while the overall severe weather threat diminished. However, around 9 p.m. CDT another cluster of vigorous convection rolled in from the west, yielding a few reports of marginally-severe winds in Furnas County. These were the last severe reports of the evening, with only a large shield of mainly light to moderate rain persisting well past midnight, while gradually ending from west-to-east. ||Closing with some meteorological background, this was a well-anticipated round of severe storms and heavy rainfall, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Nebraska around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a fairly well-defined and generally west-east oriented quasi-stationary front stretched near the Nebraska-Kansas-border, with the majority of South Central Nebraska residing just north of this boundary in an environment characterized by east-northeast breezes, afternoon temperatures in the 80s F and dewpoints in the upper 60s-low 70s F.

There were several reports of large hail (up to baseball size), damaging winds (up to around 70 MPH), a few pockets of very heavy rainfall into mainly the 3-5 range, and one brief EF-0 tornado. This tornado, which exhibited multi-vortex structure along its short path, was caught on video by a storm chaser near Huntley in eastern Harlan County around 5:45 p.m. CDT. Shortly before dropping the tornado, this high-precipitation (HP) supercell storm also yielded tennis ball to baseball size hail several miles north of Orleans. Other notable hail reports on this day included 2 diameter stones near Franklin and ping pong ball size near Blue Hill. As for damaging winds, the highest measured gusts (unofficial sources) featured 71 MPH near Carleton and 63 MPH near Holbrook. At least minor tree/branch damage was reported in or near Cambridge and Naponee, and power lines were blown down near Republican City. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the 24-county area received at least 1 of mostly-welcomed rainfall. However, there were generally four distinct zones that got drenched with noticeably higher amounts of at least 3-4, and locally more. These included portions of the following counties: much of southern/eastern Thayer; much of northern Furnas and adjacent portions of Gosper/Phelps/Harlan; parts of northern Nuckolls/southern Clay; and parts of northeastern York. A few of the highest official 24-hour totals (NWS coop and CoCoRaHS observers) featured: 5.14 northeast of Chester, 4.52 near Deweese, 3.86 in Edison and 3.80 in Hubbell. There was also an unofficial report of a whopping 7 south of Gilead in far southeast Thayer County. Although there were surely several instances of fairly minor flooding and even brief flash flooding, ground truth reports were rather limited. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing, the first strong to severe storms of the afternoon fired up between 3:30-5:00 p.m. CDT on opposite ends of the local area, with one cluster in Thayer County and the other centered over Furnas County. During the next couple hours, intense multicell convection gradually connected the gap between the original two clusters, eventually resulting in one semi-organized band. However, during this same time, the most intense storm of the day took center stage as an embedded HP supercell tracked across much of Harlan and southern Franklin counties, producing very large hail and the aforementioned brief tornado. Between 7 p.m. CDT and nightfall, convection expanded in areal coverage to encompass most all of South Central Nebraska, while the overall severe weather threat diminished. However, around 9 p.m. CDT another cluster of vigorous convection rolled in from the west, yielding a few reports of marginally-severe winds in Furnas County. These were the last severe reports of the evening, with only a large shield of mainly light to moderate rain persisting well past midnight, while gradually ending from west-to-east. ||Closing with some meteorological background, this was a well-anticipated round of severe storms and heavy rainfall, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Nebraska around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a fairly well-defined and generally west-east oriented quasi-stationary front stretched near the Nebraska-Kansas-border, with the majority of South Central Nebraska residing just north of this boundary in an environment characterized by east-northeast breezes, afternoon temperatures in the 80s F and dewpoints in the upper 60s-low 70s F.

These were the last severe reports of the evening, with only a large shield of mainly light to moderate rain persisting well past midnight, while gradually ending from west-to-east. ||Closing with some meteorological background, this was a well-anticipated round of severe storms and heavy rainfall, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Nebraska around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a fairly well-defined and generally west-east oriented quasi-stationary front stretched near the Nebraska-Kansas-border, with the majority of South Central Nebraska residing just north of this boundary in an environment characterized by east-northeast breezes, afternoon temperatures in the 80s F and dewpoints in the upper 60s-low 70s F. During the height of severe storm development, the mesoscale environment featured between 30-50 knots of deep-layer wind shear and mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg.",A storm total rainfall amount of 3.24 inches occurred six miles west-northwest of North Loup.,CSV

The strongest-known measured wind was 74 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island, shortly before 2 a.m. CDT. Other notable measured wind gusts included: 64 MPH at Ord airport, 62 MPH at both Hastings and York airports, and 59 MPH at Kearney airport. Ground-truth damage reports were fairly limited, but a cooperative observer near Shelby reported 7 diameter tree limbs down, and several overturned irrigation pivots in the area. In addition, a power line was downed by a fallen tree in Shelton, and power was also knocked out for a time in Red Cloud. This was almost purely a wind event, with storms producing little-to-no-hail, and the vast majority of severe gusts concentrating east-northeast of a line from western Buffalo County to Webster County. ||Timing-wise, the leading edge of the squall line entered the far northern local area (Valley County) shortly after midnight CDT, with outflow winds surging several miles out ahead of the trailing precipitation core. Severe winds reached the Highway 30 corridor around 2 a.m. CDT, and a line from roughly Hastings-York by around 2:30 a.m. CDT. The last evidence of severe weather within the local area consisted of 60 MPH winds at a mesonet station near Nelson at 319 a.m. CDT. Well before reaching South Central Nebraska, the initial severe convection that eventually morphed into this fast-moving squall line developed over south central South Dakota during the late afternoon/early evening of the 8th. In the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly classic setup for nocturnal severe weather. While forcing was not overly-strong, a low-amplitude disturbance tracked across mainly northern NE/southern SD through the night, embedded within a broad, quasi-zonal flow regime. Once the afternoon/early evening storms over southern SD grew upscale into an organized MCS, southeastward propagation into the local area was fostered by a southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) strengthening to 30-40 knots.

The lone, marginally-severe report consisted of estimated 60 MPH gusts in Burr Oak at 7:30 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, the vast majority of the area received at least 1, and large portions of five of the six counties (except Phillips) received at least 2-3 of rather-needed rain. However, somewhat excessive amounts of 3-4+ occurred in much of Mitchell, Smith and eastern Jewell counties, with some of the highest official 24-hour totals (NWS coop and CoCoRaHS observers) featuring: 4.63 at Formoso, 4.33 near Webber, 4.30 at Smith Center and 3.87 at Cawker City. Although there were surely instances of fairly minor flooding and possibly even brief flash flooding, ground truth reports were rather limited. However, one automated river gauge in the area detected minor flooding, as the gauge along the White Rock Creek east of Burr Oak eventually crested around 16.6 ft. on the morning of the 21st (flood stage is 15 ft.). ||Breaking down event evolution/timing, isolated strong storms bubbled up intermittently over mainly Mitchell/Jewell counties between 3:30-6:00 p.m. CDT. Then during the ensuing three hours, convection increased in coverage and intensity across the area as a whole, due in part to one storm complex building southward out of Nebraska, and another brushing into the area out of west-central Kansas. By around 9 p.m. CDT, the strongest storms had departed to the east-southeast. However, between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. CDT, the southern fringes of the local area were skirted by the northern edges of a squall line tracking through central Kansas, bringing another uptick in gusty sub-severe winds and heavy rain before all activity finally faded for the night. Closing with some meteorological background, this day held well-anticipated potential for severe storms and heavy rain, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Kansas around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies.

Fortunately, severe weather reports were fairly limited in number and primarily concentrated within northern counties, with convection exhibiting a gradually-weakening trend as it sank south of the Interstate 80 corridor. Among the highlights of this event included a brief tornado just east of Ord, ping pong ball size hail near Loup City, and numerous broken tree branches up to 6 inches in diameter near Shelby. This storm complex was largely non-severe farther south, although a mesonet station in southwestern Clay County managed to clock an isolated 58 MPH gust. ||As for timing, the initial severe storms of the afternoon/early-evening developed slightly north of the local area, and it wasn't until 830-930 p.m. CDT that quasi-linear convection entered Valley/Sherman/Greeley counties. Over the next few hours, this squall line expanded farther southwest, while also becoming more west-east oriented and gradually losing overall-intensity. Eventually, between 230-330 a.m. CDT on the 2nd, storms departed into Kansas from far southeastern local counties such as Nuckolls/Thayer. From a meteorological perspective, this was a fairly classic late-spring severe weather setup. In the mid-upper levels, a shortwave trough tracked from the northern/central Rockies toward the Dakotas between the 1st and the 2nd, with Nebraska along the southern periphery of strongest forcing. At the surface, Nebraska resided in between primary low pressure centers during the evening, with one mainly over ND and the other in western KS. Severe storms initially developed along a pre-frontal trough, with the actual north-south oriented cold front passing through South Central Nebraska during the overnight hours. Ahead of these boundaries, a very unstable airmass developed locally, with early evening temperatures around 90 F and dewpoints around 70 F yielding mixed-layer CAPE around 3000 J/kg. Combined with moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots and a strengthening nocturnal low level jet of 40+ knots, this was a somewhat volatile environment for severe weather. However, overall storm severity ended up underachieving somewhat locally. For one thing, the early-onset of a linear storm mode likely muted the large hail threat. Secondly, the more concentrated swath of severe-criteria winds ended up targeting eastern Nebraska more so than south central parts of the state.",,CSV

Fortunately, severe weather reports were fairly limited in number and primarily concentrated within northern counties, with convection exhibiting a gradually-weakening trend as it sank south of the Interstate 80 corridor. Among the highlights of this event included a brief tornado just east of Ord, ping pong ball size hail near Loup City, and numerous broken tree branches up to 6 inches in diameter near Shelby. This storm complex was largely non-severe farther south, although a mesonet station in southwestern Clay County managed to clock an isolated 58 MPH gust. ||As for timing, the initial severe storms of the afternoon/early-evening developed slightly north of the local area, and it wasn't until 830-930 p.m. CDT that quasi-linear convection entered Valley/Sherman/Greeley counties. Over the next few hours, this squall line expanded farther southwest, while also becoming more west-east oriented and gradually losing overall-intensity. Eventually, between 230-330 a.m. CDT on the 2nd, storms departed into Kansas from far southeastern local counties such as Nuckolls/Thayer. From a meteorological perspective, this was a fairly classic late-spring severe weather setup. In the mid-upper levels, a shortwave trough tracked from the northern/central Rockies toward the Dakotas between the 1st and the 2nd, with Nebraska along the southern periphery of strongest forcing. At the surface, Nebraska resided in between primary low pressure centers during the evening, with one mainly over ND and the other in western KS. Severe storms initially developed along a pre-frontal trough, with the actual north-south oriented cold front passing through South Central Nebraska during the overnight hours. Ahead of these boundaries, a very unstable airmass developed locally, with early evening temperatures around 90 F and dewpoints around 70 F yielding mixed-layer CAPE around 3000 J/kg. Combined with moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots and a strengthening nocturnal low level jet of 40+ knots, this was a somewhat volatile environment for severe weather.

Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH.

Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan. ||When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.||Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon.

Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan. ||When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east.

Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan. ||When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.||Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",A 59 mph wind gust was measured at the Hebron Airport.,CSV

A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan. ||When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.||Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",A 62 mph thunderstorm wind gust was recorded one mile east southeast of Fairmont.,CSV

Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas.

Fortunately, severe weather reports were fairly limited in number and primarily concentrated within northern counties, with convection exhibiting a gradually-weakening trend as it sank south of the Interstate 80 corridor. Among the highlights of this event included a brief tornado just east of Ord, ping pong ball size hail near Loup City, and numerous broken tree branches up to 6 inches in diameter near Shelby. This storm complex was largely non-severe farther south, although a mesonet station in southwestern Clay County managed to clock an isolated 58 MPH gust. ||As for timing, the initial severe storms of the afternoon/early-evening developed slightly north of the local area, and it wasn't until 830-930 p.m. CDT that quasi-linear convection entered Valley/Sherman/Greeley counties. Over the next few hours, this squall line expanded farther southwest, while also becoming more west-east oriented and gradually losing overall-intensity. Eventually, between 230-330 a.m. CDT on the 2nd, storms departed into Kansas from far southeastern local counties such as Nuckolls/Thayer. From a meteorological perspective, this was a fairly classic late-spring severe weather setup. In the mid-upper levels, a shortwave trough tracked from the northern/central Rockies toward the Dakotas between the 1st and the 2nd, with Nebraska along the southern periphery of strongest forcing. At the surface, Nebraska resided in between primary low pressure centers during the evening, with one mainly over ND and the other in western KS. Severe storms initially developed along a pre-frontal trough, with the actual north-south oriented cold front passing through South Central Nebraska during the overnight hours. Ahead of these boundaries, a very unstable airmass developed locally, with early evening temperatures around 90 F and dewpoints around 70 F yielding mixed-layer CAPE around 3000 J/kg. Combined with moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots and a strengthening nocturnal low level jet of 40+ knots, this was a somewhat volatile environment for severe weather. However, overall storm severity ended up underachieving somewhat locally. For one thing, the early-onset of a linear storm mode likely muted the large hail threat. Secondly, the more concentrated swath of severe-criteria winds ended up targeting eastern Nebraska more so than south central parts of the state.",,CSV

Other notable measured wind gusts included: 64 MPH at Ord airport, 62 MPH at both Hastings and York airports, and 59 MPH at Kearney airport. Ground-truth damage reports were fairly limited, but a cooperative observer near Shelby reported 7 diameter tree limbs down, and several overturned irrigation pivots in the area. In addition, a power line was downed by a fallen tree in Shelton, and power was also knocked out for a time in Red Cloud. This was almost purely a wind event, with storms producing little-to-no-hail, and the vast majority of severe gusts concentrating east-northeast of a line from western Buffalo County to Webster County. ||Timing-wise, the leading edge of the squall line entered the far northern local area (Valley County) shortly after midnight CDT, with outflow winds surging several miles out ahead of the trailing precipitation core. Severe winds reached the Highway 30 corridor around 2 a.m. CDT, and a line from roughly Hastings-York by around 2:30 a.m. CDT. The last evidence of severe weather within the local area consisted of 60 MPH winds at a mesonet station near Nelson at 319 a.m. CDT.

In the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly classic setup for nocturnal severe weather. While forcing was not overly-strong, a low-amplitude disturbance tracked across mainly northern NE/southern SD through the night, embedded within a broad, quasi-zonal flow regime. Once the afternoon/early evening storms over southern SD grew upscale into an organized MCS, southeastward propagation into the local area was fostered by a southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) strengthening to 30-40 knots.

Severe winds reached the Highway 30 corridor around 2 a.m. CDT, and a line from roughly Hastings-York by around 2:30 a.m. CDT. The last evidence of severe weather within the local area consisted of 60 MPH winds at a mesonet station near Nelson at 319 a.m. CDT. Well before reaching South Central Nebraska, the initial severe convection that eventually morphed into this fast-moving squall line developed over south central South Dakota during the late afternoon/early evening of the 8th. In the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly classic setup for nocturnal severe weather. While forcing was not overly-strong, a low-amplitude disturbance tracked across mainly northern NE/southern SD through the night, embedded within a broad, quasi-zonal flow regime. Once the afternoon/early evening storms over southern SD grew upscale into an organized MCS, southeastward propagation into the local area was fostered by a southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) strengthening to 30-40 knots. Around the time convection surged into northern local counties, mesoscale parameters featured around 1000-2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots.","Wind gusts were estimated at 60 MPH just north of Red Cloud, where the power went out from the strong wind gusts.",CSV

To be sure, this was a complex storm precipitation-wise, as snow totals fell short of forecasted expectations across much of the area. Nonetheless, the combination of strong winds, slick roads and pockets of drastically-reduced visibility made travel treacherous in many counties. In addition, power outages were fairly widespread, especially north and west of the Tri Cities, where communities such as Arcadia went over 24 hours without power (closer to 48 hours in rural areas). As just a sampling of various known impacts: 1) Interstate 80 was closed from Grand Island westward to Wyoming through much of the 14th, and did not completely re-open until the morning of the 15th...2) In the Howard/Greeley Rural Public Power District, a 40-year veteran employee stated this storm damaged more power poles than any in his career...3) The Region 26 EMA communications tower north of Ord toppled during the early morning hours of the 14th due to heavy ice accrual and intense north winds.||As for official snow amounts from NWS observers, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 2, especially from the Tri Cities and south/east from there, including only 1.4 at Grand Island and 1.2 at Hastings. However, most locations generally west of a line from Greeley-Minden saw more of a snow/blizzard impact, with higher totals mainly in the 3-5 range. Of all local counties, Valley, Sherman and Buffalo seemed to receive the most snow, including totals of 5.5 in Ord, 4.7 in Kearney and 4.0 at Arcadia. Mainly preceding the snow, much of the area also had at least a few tenths of an inch of accretion (likely in excess of one-half inch in northwestern counties), due to a combination of flash freeze from rapidly falling temperatures and also at least a few hours of steady freezing drizzle/freezing rain. Above all else though, the key element that really defined this storm was intense north winds, with most places enduring at least 12-18 hours of sustained speeds generally 30-40 MPH and frequent gusts at least 50-60 MPH. Most of the peak gusts occurred during the pre-dawn hours of the 14th, including the following at primary airport sites: 64 MPH at Ord, 63 MPH at Hastings, 59 MPH at Grand Island and 58 MPH at Kearney. Also of note were the record-cold temperatures that accompanied this system. High temperatures on both the 14th and 15th only topped out between the upper 20s and mid 30s in most of South Central Nebraska, or roughly 30 degrees below normal for mid-April. Grand Island and Hastings established new record-cold maximum temperatures on both days (30-31 degrees), which also marked the latest-on-record spring occurrence of sub-freezing max temperatures!||Finishing up with a closer look at storm timing and meteorological background: Things starting getting underway on the afternoon and evening of the 13th, as pockets of mainly non-freezing rain/drizzle developed in advance of a powerful, closed mid-level low migrating along western sections of the Nebraska-Kansas border. By later evening and into the morning of the 14th, temperatures gradually fell below freezing from northwest-to-southeast, transitioning rain/drizzle over to freezing rain/freezing drizzle in many areas, while the primary snow band set up in north-south fashion through the Ord-Kearney-Holdrege areas. Also during the night, north winds began roaring in response to an intense surface pressure gradient on the backside of a roughly 1000 millibar low centered in far southeast Nebraska (the pressure difference across the entire state at this time was at least 25 millibars!) During the daylight hours on the 14th, several loosely organized snow bands continued rotating north-to-south across the area on the backside of the parent upper low pressure system, which reached the KS/NE/IA/MO border area by sunset. Finally, that evening into the early morning of the 15th, the last few bands of light snow/flurries pushed out of the region and winds continued to diminish, with gusts largely under 30 MPH by this time.","Frequent wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph occurred. Visibility was frequently down to one quarter mile or less with blowing, drifting, and falling snow. Travel was perilous. Three inches of snow were reported on the north side of Johnson Lake, and one inch accumulation with 18 inch snow drifts was reported on the east side of Johnson Lake.",CSV

A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof.

In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage.

To be sure, this was a complex storm precipitation-wise, as snow totals fell short of forecasted expectations across much of the area. Nonetheless, the combination of strong winds, slick roads and pockets of drastically-reduced visibility made travel treacherous in many counties. In addition, power outages were fairly widespread, especially north and west of the Tri Cities, where communities such as Arcadia went over 24 hours without power (closer to 48 hours in rural areas). As just a sampling of various known impacts: 1) Interstate 80 was closed from Grand Island westward to Wyoming through much of the 14th, and did not completely re-open until the morning of the 15th...2) In the Howard/Greeley Rural Public Power District, a 40-year veteran employee stated this storm damaged more power poles than any in his career...3) The Region 26 EMA communications tower north of Ord toppled during the early morning hours of the 14th due to heavy ice accrual and intense north winds.||As for official snow amounts from NWS observers, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 2, especially from the Tri Cities and south/east from there, including only 1.4 at Grand Island and 1.2 at Hastings. However, most locations generally west of a line from Greeley-Minden saw more of a snow/blizzard impact, with higher totals mainly in the 3-5 range. Of all local counties, Valley, Sherman and Buffalo seemed to receive the most snow, including totals of 5.5 in Ord, 4.7 in Kearney and 4.0 at Arcadia. Mainly preceding the snow, much of the area also had at least a few tenths of an inch of accretion (likely in excess of one-half inch in northwestern counties), due to a combination of flash freeze from rapidly falling temperatures and also at least a few hours of steady freezing drizzle/freezing rain. Above all else though, the key element that really defined this storm was intense north winds, with most places enduring at least 12-18 hours of sustained speeds generally 30-40 MPH and frequent gusts at least 50-60 MPH. Most of the peak gusts occurred during the pre-dawn hours of the 14th, including the following at primary airport sites: 64 MPH at Ord, 63 MPH at Hastings, 59 MPH at Grand Island and 58 MPH at Kearney. Also of note were the record-cold temperatures that accompanied this system. High temperatures on both the 14th and 15th only topped out between the upper 20s and mid 30s in most of South Central Nebraska, or roughly 30 degrees below normal for mid-April. Grand Island and Hastings established new record-cold maximum temperatures on both days (30-31 degrees), which also marked the latest-on-record spring occurrence of sub-freezing max temperatures!||Finishing up with a closer look at storm timing and meteorological background: Things starting getting underway on the afternoon and evening of the 13th, as pockets of mainly non-freezing rain/drizzle developed in advance of a powerful, closed mid-level low migrating along western sections of the Nebraska-Kansas border. By later evening and into the morning of the 14th, temperatures gradually fell below freezing from northwest-to-southeast, transitioning rain/drizzle over to freezing rain/freezing drizzle in many areas, while the primary snow band set up in north-south fashion through the Ord-Kearney-Holdrege areas. Also during the night, north winds began roaring in response to an intense surface pressure gradient on the backside of a roughly 1000 millibar low centered in far southeast Nebraska (the pressure difference across the entire state at this time was at least 25 millibars!) During the daylight hours on the 14th, several loosely organized snow bands continued rotating north-to-south across the area on the backside of the parent upper low pressure system, which reached the KS/NE/IA/MO border area by sunset. Finally, that evening into the early morning of the 15th, the last few bands of light snow/flurries pushed out of the region and winds continued to diminish, with gusts largely under 30 MPH by this time.","Frequent wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph occurred, peaking at 63 mph at 1:34 a.m. CST on the 14th at the Hastings Airport.

Grand Island and Hastings established new record-cold maximum temperatures on both days (30-31 degrees), which also marked the latest-on-record spring occurrence of sub-freezing max temperatures!||Finishing up with a closer look at storm timing and meteorological background: Things starting getting underway on the afternoon and evening of the 13th, as pockets of mainly non-freezing rain/drizzle developed in advance of a powerful, closed mid-level low migrating along western sections of the Nebraska-Kansas border. By later evening and into the morning of the 14th, temperatures gradually fell below freezing from northwest-to-southeast, transitioning rain/drizzle over to freezing rain/freezing drizzle in many areas, while the primary snow band set up in north-south fashion through the Ord-Kearney-Holdrege areas. Also during the night, north winds began roaring in response to an intense surface pressure gradient on the backside of a roughly 1000 millibar low centered in far southeast Nebraska (the pressure difference across the entire state at this time was at least 25 millibars!) During the daylight hours on the 14th, several loosely organized snow bands continued rotating north-to-south across the area on the backside of the parent upper low pressure system, which reached the KS/NE/IA/MO border area by sunset. Finally, that evening into the early morning of the 15th, the last few bands of light snow/flurries pushed out of the region and winds continued to diminish, with gusts largely under 30 MPH by this time.","Frequent wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph occurred. Visibility was frequently down to one quarter mile or less with blowing, drifting, and falling snow. Travel was perilous. A snowfall total of 3.2 inches was reported in Greeley by a cooperative observer.",CSV

The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas.

Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH.

For most places though, storms were fairly weak, producing only rainfall and modest wind gusts. However, there were two glaring and rather localized exceptions featuring ground-truth of severe wind gusts, one in the far northeast portion of the local area and the other in the southwest. More specifically, around 815 p.m. CDT on the 6th, a southward-surging outflow boundary with estimated wind gusts to 70 MPH destroyed a metal outbuilding a few miles northeast of Osceola (northwest of Shelby). Then several hours later, shortly after 3 a.m. CDT on the 7th, a surge of very intense winds along a bowing line segment (measured at 91 MPH on a personal weather station) caused considerable damage in a small portion of western Harlan County between Orleans and Oxford, including: uprooted trees, overturned pivots and windows blown out of a home.||Breaking down the evolution of thunderstorms over the course of this time frame, things first initiated in far northeast portions of the local area during the mid-afternoon and late-evening hours. As early as around 4 p.m. CDT, an isolated storm produced nickel size hail near Fullerton. While this early activity faded quickly, a few hours later a cluster of severe storms developed slightly north of Polk/Nance counties, with the resultant southward-surging outflow causing the Polk County damage before sunset. Interestingly, this damage occurred at least 5-10 miles south of the leading edge of any rainfall. During the next few hours, until around 11 p.m. CDT, a northwest-southeast oriented line of strong storms continued affecting mainly Nance and northern Greeley counties, but there were no additional severe-criteria reports. As the pre-midnight activity was occurring in the northeast, a separate cluster of strong to severe storms developed well off to the west in the Nebraska-Colorado-Kansas border region, eventually tracking into far southwestern portions of the local area between midnight-1 a.m. CDT in the form of a linear mesoscale convective system (MCS). Although the majority of severe-criteria wind gusts associated with this complex focused just to the south within northwest/north central Kansas, a northward-surging bow in the convective line developed rather abruptly over southwestern Harlan County around 2:30 a.m. CDT. This small-scale feature soon caused the aforementioned, extensive-but-localized damage in west-central Harlan County. Winds diminished in intensity as they swept north into Phelps County, but a mesonet station north-northwest of Holdrege still managed a 58 MPH gust at 3:41 a.m. CDT. This was the last severe weather report of the day, as convection steadily weakened and diminished in coverage through the mid-morning hours.||In the mid-upper levels, these events of the 6th-7th occurred in a subtly-forced environment, as Nebraska resided under weak westerly flow along the northern periphery of a ridge extending up from the Southern Plains. As a result, deep-layer wind shear was weak, only averaging around 25 knots or less.

For most places though, storms were fairly weak, producing only rainfall and modest wind gusts. However, there were two glaring and rather localized exceptions featuring ground-truth of severe wind gusts, one in the far northeast portion of the local area and the other in the southwest. More specifically, around 815 p.m. CDT on the 6th, a southward-surging outflow boundary with estimated wind gusts to 70 MPH destroyed a metal outbuilding a few miles northeast of Osceola (northwest of Shelby). Then several hours later, shortly after 3 a.m. CDT on the 7th, a surge of very intense winds along a bowing line segment (measured at 91 MPH on a personal weather station) caused considerable damage in a small portion of western Harlan County between Orleans and Oxford, including: uprooted trees, overturned pivots and windows blown out of a home.||Breaking down the evolution of thunderstorms over the course of this time frame, things first initiated in far northeast portions of the local area during the mid-afternoon and late-evening hours. As early as around 4 p.m. CDT, an isolated storm produced nickel size hail near Fullerton. While this early activity faded quickly, a few hours later a cluster of severe storms developed slightly north of Polk/Nance counties, with the resultant southward-surging outflow causing the Polk County damage before sunset. Interestingly, this damage occurred at least 5-10 miles south of the leading edge of any rainfall. During the next few hours, until around 11 p.m. CDT, a northwest-southeast oriented line of strong storms continued affecting mainly Nance and northern Greeley counties, but there were no additional severe-criteria reports. As the pre-midnight activity was occurring in the northeast, a separate cluster of strong to severe storms developed well off to the west in the Nebraska-Colorado-Kansas border region, eventually tracking into far southwestern portions of the local area between midnight-1 a.m. CDT in the form of a linear mesoscale convective system (MCS). Although the majority of severe-criteria wind gusts associated with this complex focused just to the south within northwest/north central Kansas, a northward-surging bow in the convective line developed rather abruptly over southwestern Harlan County around 2:30 a.m. CDT. This small-scale feature soon caused the aforementioned, extensive-but-localized damage in west-central Harlan County. Winds diminished in intensity as they swept north into Phelps County, but a mesonet station north-northwest of Holdrege still managed a 58 MPH gust at 3:41 a.m. CDT. This was the last severe weather report of the day, as convection steadily weakened and diminished in coverage through the mid-morning hours.||In the mid-upper levels, these events of the 6th-7th occurred in a subtly-forced environment, as Nebraska resided under weak westerly flow along the northern periphery of a ridge extending up from the Southern Plains. As a result, deep-layer wind shear was weak, only averaging around 25 knots or less. However, there was plentiful instability, as the combination of afternoon temperatures in the 90s F and dewpoints well into the 60s F yielded mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon/early-evening. At the surface, this activity occurred to the south of a west-east oriented, quasi-stationary front draped through northern Nebraska.",A large metal outbuilding flipped over and a large tree was knocked over as very strong outflow headed south of a line of thunderstorms.,CSV

To be sure, this was a complex storm precipitation-wise, as snow totals fell short of forecasted expectations across much of the area. Nonetheless, the combination of strong winds, slick roads and pockets of drastically-reduced visibility made travel treacherous in many counties. In addition, power outages were fairly widespread, especially north and west of the Tri Cities, where communities such as Arcadia went over 24 hours without power (closer to 48 hours in rural areas). As just a sampling of various known impacts: 1) Interstate 80 was closed from Grand Island westward to Wyoming through much of the 14th, and did not completely re-open until the morning of the 15th...2) In the Howard/Greeley Rural Public Power District, a 40-year veteran employee stated this storm damaged more power poles than any in his career...3) The Region 26 EMA communications tower north of Ord toppled during the early morning hours of the 14th due to heavy ice accrual and intense north winds.||As for official snow amounts from NWS observers, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 2, especially from the Tri Cities and south/east from there, including only 1.4 at Grand Island and 1.2 at Hastings. However, most locations generally west of a line from Greeley-Minden saw more of a snow/blizzard impact, with higher totals mainly in the 3-5 range. Of all local counties, Valley, Sherman and Buffalo seemed to receive the most snow, including totals of 5.5 in Ord, 4.7 in Kearney and 4.0 at Arcadia. Mainly preceding the snow, much of the area also had at least a few tenths of an inch of accretion (likely in excess of one-half inch in northwestern counties), due to a combination of flash freeze from rapidly falling temperatures and also at least a few hours of steady freezing drizzle/freezing rain. Above all else though, the key element that really defined this storm was intense north winds, with most places enduring at least 12-18 hours of sustained speeds generally 30-40 MPH and frequent gusts at least 50-60 MPH. Most of the peak gusts occurred during the pre-dawn hours of the 14th, including the following at primary airport sites: 64 MPH at Ord, 63 MPH at Hastings, 59 MPH at Grand Island and 58 MPH at Kearney.

To be sure, this was a complex storm precipitation-wise, as snow totals fell short of forecasted expectations across much of the area. Nonetheless, the combination of strong winds, slick roads and pockets of drastically-reduced visibility made travel treacherous in many counties. In addition, power outages were fairly widespread, especially north and west of the Tri Cities, where communities such as Arcadia went over 24 hours without power (closer to 48 hours in rural areas). As just a sampling of various known impacts: 1) Interstate 80 was closed from Grand Island westward to Wyoming through much of the 14th, and did not completely re-open until the morning of the 15th...2) In the Howard/Greeley Rural Public Power District, a 40-year veteran employee stated this storm damaged more power poles than any in his career...3) The Region 26 EMA communications tower north of Ord toppled during the early morning hours of the 14th due to heavy ice accrual and intense north winds.||As for official snow amounts from NWS observers, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 2, especially from the Tri Cities and south/east from there, including only 1.4 at Grand Island and 1.2 at Hastings. However, most locations generally west of a line from Greeley-Minden saw more of a snow/blizzard impact, with higher totals mainly in the 3-5 range. Of all local counties, Valley, Sherman and Buffalo seemed to receive the most snow, including totals of 5.5 in Ord, 4.7 in Kearney and 4.0 at Arcadia. Mainly preceding the snow, much of the area also had at least a few tenths of an inch of accretion (likely in excess of one-half inch in northwestern counties), due to a combination of flash freeze from rapidly falling temperatures and also at least a few hours of steady freezing drizzle/freezing rain. Above all else though, the key element that really defined this storm was intense north winds, with most places enduring at least 12-18 hours of sustained speeds generally 30-40 MPH and frequent gusts at least 50-60 MPH. Most of the peak gusts occurred during the pre-dawn hours of the 14th, including the following at primary airport sites: 64 MPH at Ord, 63 MPH at Hastings, 59 MPH at Grand Island and 58 MPH at Kearney. Also of note were the record-cold temperatures that accompanied this system. High temperatures on both the 14th and 15th only topped out between the upper 20s and mid 30s in most of South Central Nebraska, or roughly 30 degrees below normal for mid-April. Grand Island and Hastings established new record-cold maximum temperatures on both days (30-31 degrees), which also marked the latest-on-record spring occurrence of sub-freezing max temperatures!||Finishing up with a closer look at storm timing and meteorological background: Things starting getting underway on the afternoon and evening of the 13th, as pockets of mainly non-freezing rain/drizzle developed in advance of a powerful, closed mid-level low migrating along western sections of the Nebraska-Kansas border. By later evening and into the morning of the 14th, temperatures gradually fell below freezing from northwest-to-southeast, transitioning rain/drizzle over to freezing rain/freezing drizzle in many areas, while the primary snow band set up in north-south fashion through the Ord-Kearney-Holdrege areas. Also during the night, north winds began roaring in response to an intense surface pressure gradient on the backside of a roughly 1000 millibar low centered in far southeast Nebraska (the pressure difference across the entire state at this time was at least 25 millibars!) During the daylight hours on the 14th, several loosely organized snow bands continued rotating north-to-south across the area on the backside of the parent upper low pressure system, which reached the KS/NE/IA/MO border area by sunset. Finally, that evening into the early morning of the 15th, the last few bands of light snow/flurries pushed out of the region and winds continued to diminish, with gusts largely under 30 MPH by this time.","Frequent wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph occurred. Visibility was frequently down to one mile or less with blowing, drifting, and falling snow. Travel was difficult.",CSV

On both days, primarily the afternoon featured several hours of sustained speeds commonly 25-35 MPH (isolated 40 MPH) and frequent gusts to around 50 MPH, along with isolated severe-criteria gusts of 58+ MPH. Also on both days, the combination of recent dry conditions and recently-tilled fields promoted a number of localized dust storms, causing drastic visibility reductions over short distances. Specifically on the late afternoon of the 29th, dust blowing across Interstate 80 near the Aurora exit led to a major pileup of 29 vehicles, closing I-80 for over two hours. Sadly, this incident resulted in one fatality and over a dozen injuries. ||As for measured winds from a variety of official and unofficial sources, a few peak gusts on the 29th featured: 62 MPH near Kearney (mesonet), 59 MPH near Oxford (mesonet), and 58 MPH at Grand Island and Ord airports. At Kearney Regional Airport, sustained winds averaged 40 MPH for an hour, mainly between 12-1 PM CDT. Although it remained quite breezy even after dark, gusts by late evening largely eased below 40 MPH. Turning to the meteorological background, this was a classic recipe for prolonged, strong south winds across the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, an expansive, large-scale trough gradually deepened over the western CONUS, only edging slowly eastward. This in turn promoted strengthening surface low pressure across the Central High Plains, averaging around 998 millibars in eastern Colorado. This low pressure, in concert with sprawling high pressure centered over the eastern CONUS, set up a healthy pressure gradient. During the height of the strongest winds on the 29th, the state of Nebraska featured roughly a 16-millibar gradient, ranging from around 1000 millibars in the western Panhandle, to around 1016 millibars in far southeast counties.","Sustained southerly winds of at least 30 MPH and frequent gusts over 40 MPH resulted in an extended period of blowing dust out of freshly tilled fields.

While they were initially supercells, these storms weakened from destructive interference as they moved south-southeast. One storm did produce a little nickel size hail over southwest Valley county around 7 PM CST. The main show was an incredible supercell that developed near Mason City around that time. The storm moved across Sherman, Buffalo, and Kearney counties over the following 2 hours, and put on a spectacular lightning and cloud-structure show. The storm was all by itself. People were taking pictures of the storm as far away as Harlan County Lake. This storm produced hail up to the size of golf balls from near Litchfield all the way down to just east of Kearney. There were spotty areas of crop damage, from hail and wind, along the way. The largest hail was the size of baseballs in Hazard, but there must have been a small number as there was very little damage visible the following day. The storm probably remained severe into northern Kearney county, but no additional reports were received south of I-80. The storm then weakened after 9 PM CST.

Because these storms affected the same area of Buffalo county, there is uncertainty on which storm produced the crop damage. These storms weakened and dissipated during the late evening hours.

The largest hail was the size of ping pong balls and golf balls. A grain bin was blown off its foundation and across a road east of Ord, and several tree branches, some of which were very large, were snapped off in Grand Island and the town of Giltner. The storm cluster weakened after it moved out of Hamilton county.||As was the case on many days in this persistent late-month pattern, there was no obvious trigger for these storms. High pressure extended from southern Alberta to Pennsylvania. The previous front that moved through on Wednesday the 25th was stationary from the Gulf Coast across Texas into Colorado and the Northern Rockies. In the upper-levels, a subtropical high was over the Desert Southwest and a low was near James Bay, Canada. Low-amplitude, cyclonic west-northwest flow was over the Central Plains. Preceding the storms, temperatures had dropped to near 70 degrees, while dewpoints were in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were near 7 C/km with MUCAPE around 2000 J/kg. With unusually strong winds aloft, deep layer shear was near 45 kt.","Wind gusts of at least 60 MPH were reported, with the Grand Island Airport ASOS recording peak gusts of 80 MPH at 10:47 PM CDT and 88 MPH at 10:49 PM CDT. There was tree damage reported on the north and east sides of Grand Island, including several downed large tree branches and a tree approximately 14 inches in diameter being snapped off. At the airport, tree and minor outbuilding damage was reported. This storm also included up to golf ball size hail.",CSV

This storm evolved from small multicell cluster of storms over southern Custer county early in the evening. This cluster moved south-southeast across Gosper and Furnas counties between 830 and 10 PM CST. The cluster of storms was strongest over Gosper and eastern Furnas counties where it generated winds strong enough to snap small tree limbs near Johnson Lake. A nearby mesonet station measured winds of 57 mph. Winds of 59 mph were also measured in the town of Edison.||The region was in the cool sector. High pressure was over the Northern Rockies. The weak cold front that moved through the previous Wednesday was stationary across northern Texas. In the upper-levels, moderately-amplified northwest flow was over the Central Plains. A subtropical high was over the Desert Southwest with a ridge extending north in to Oregon and Washington. A trough extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. The initial cluster of storms formed from daytime heating of the high plains early in the afternoon, aided by a shortwave trough over Montana that was moving southeast. Temperatures immediately ahead of the storms were in the upper 60s, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were not even 7 deg C/km.  Nonetheless, MUCAPE was still estimated around 1500 J/kg. Winds aloft were stronger than usual for late July, resulting in deep layer shear around 40 kt.","Wind gusts were estimated to be between 60 and 65 MPH, downing tree limbs at least 2 inches in diameter.",CSV

This storm evolved from small multicell cluster of storms over southern Custer county Nebraska earlier in the evening. This cluster moved south-southeast, and by 950 PM CST, this cluster had diminished to a single but intense storm along the northern Kansas state line. This storm crossed western Phillips county between 950 and 1115 PM CST. The storm was strongest over northwestern Phillips county where it generated winds strong enough to snap 3-inch tree limbs.||The region was in the cool sector. High pressure was over the Northern Rockies. The weak cold front that moved through the previous Wednesday was stationary across northern Texas. In the upper-levels, moderately-amplified northwest flow was over the Central Plains. A subtropical high was over the Desert Southwest with a ridge extending north in to Oregon and Washington. A trough extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. The initial cluster of storms formed from daytime heating of the high plains early in the afternoon, aided by a shortwave trough over Montana that was moving southeast. Temperatures immediately ahead of the storm were in the lower 70s, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were not even 7 deg C/km. Nonetheless, MUCAPE was around 2000 J/kg. Winds aloft were stronger than usual for late July, resulting in deep layer shear around 40 kt.","Wind gusts were estimated to be near 60 MPH, downing tree limbs up to 3 inches in diameter.",CSV

During the evening hours, numerous thunderstorms developed from near McCook to North Platte to Broken Bow to Albion. Around 9 PM CST, a separate, small cluster of thunderstorms formed over eastern Dawson county. Repeated cell development kept heavy downpours over the area until 11 PM CST. Meanwhile, the tail end of the storms to the west was progressing eastward. Between 1030 and 11 PM, more thunderstorms developed within advancing tail and formed a line from central Dawson county south into Gosper county. This line then moved across the eastern part of Dawson county and into western Buffalo county between 1130 PM and 1 AM CST. More thunderstorms formed and dropped more heavy rain over these areas between 200 and 400 AM CST. Rain gauge measurements were scarce in this rural area. On the northern gradient, where radar indicated the greatest amounts fell, a CoCoRaHS observer measured 4.30 in. This excessive rainfall resulted in a flash flood roughly 7 miles north-northwest of Overton causing significant damage to a home and totaling 3 vehicles on the property. Minor flooding also occurred on Elm Creek, and low spots were flooded along several country roads in eastern Dawson county.||During the day Wednesday, low pressure was over southern Manitoba with a slow-moving cold front extending across the Dakota's into the Nebraska Panhandle. By evening, this front had become stationary from Goodland, Kansas to North Platte to O'Neill. In the upper-levels, subtropical high pressure encompassed most of the United States. A low was off the Pacific Northwest coast, and a shortwave trough was crossing the Northern Plains and southern Canada. By daybreak, the southern tip of this trough extended into Nebraska, but winds aloft were very weak. Just before thunderstorms moved into the area, temperatures had fallen into the middle 70s and dewpoints were in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were near 7 C/km, with MUCAPE around 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was 30-35 kt. The low-level jet was weak (20-30 kt) but present with its northern terminus at the frontal zone.","Heavy rain fell across the warned area, and while actual ground-truth reports were only in the 3 to 5 inch range, radar estimation and unofficial reports exceeded 6 inches in east-central Dawson County. Emergency management reported that several rural roads and at least 2 homes were affected by water. The most significant report came from a home approximately 7 miles north-northwest of Overton. This home is located at the convergence point of a couple of drainage paths, and the heavy rainfall resulted in every room having at least 2 feet of water inside. All of the appliances and furniture were destroyed, and the interior will have to be completely redone once it's dried out.",CSV

Around 9 PM CST, a separate, small cluster of thunderstorms formed over eastern Dawson county. Repeated cell development kept heavy downpours over the area until 11 PM CST. Meanwhile, the tail end of the storms to the west was progressing eastward. Between 1030 and 11 PM, more thunderstorms developed within advancing tail and formed a line from central Dawson county south into Gosper county.

More thunderstorms formed and dropped more heavy rain over these areas between 200 and 400 AM CST. Rain gauge measurements were scarce in this rural area. On the northern gradient, where radar indicated the greatest amounts fell, a CoCoRaHS observer measured 4.30 in.

Throughout the morning and early afternoon, a narrow band of light rain, oriented from southwest-northeast, moved from eastern Colorado into western Kansas. Skies were sunny ahead of this rain band and by mid-afternoon, scattered thunderstorms began forming at its leading edge. Around 330 PM CST, these storms began moving into Phillips county, and they were part of a larger line of storms that formed along or ahead of the rain band from Sioux Falls, South Dakota to Garden City, Kansas. This line of storms crossed north central Kansas between 330 and 630 PM CST. After 530 PM CST, enough storms had formed along the common cold pool to result in the formation of a squall line over Jewell and Mitchell counties. Most of the severe weather occurred from a single storm that produced damaging downburst winds over central and northeast Rooks county, and one inch hail in southwest Smith county. That storm occurred prior to the formation of the squall line. Winds were measured as high as 70 MPH at the airport just south of Stockton, and nearby power lines were downed across Highway 183 resulting in its closure for a time. Power lines were also knocked down in the city of Stockton and a tree was blown down near Woodston. Elsewhere, the only other severe weather was a measured wind gust of 60 MPH in Beloit as the squall line moved through the city, but winds between 50 and 55 mph were measured in multiple locations in Mitchell and Jewell counties.||In the preceding days, an east-west oriented front had become quasi-stationary from the Ohio Valley across central Nebraska to Nevada.

Between 2 and 3 PM CST, the first couple storms began forming south and southwest of Hill City. Around 330 PM CST, one storm moved into southwestern Rooks county. It was joined by several other storms which continued to develop along I-70 between Wakeeney and Russell. As the Rooks county storm moved east, these storms moved north and they all merged over Osborne county. Just prior to the merger, a left-moving supercell, fresh after the split, produced hail up to the size of tennis balls near the southern border of Osborne county. After the merger, the newly-formed multicell cluster took the form of a small bow echo as it moved across Mitchell county between 5 and 6 PM CST. The mesoscale convective system produced strong downburst winds that were estimated at 60 mph over central Osborne county and measured at 66 mph over Mitchell county, just west of Beloit. While this was occurring, other cells formed over Jewell county and became severe. Before merging, the southern storm produced a measured wind gust of 78 mph in the town of Jewell, while the northern one produced spotty wind damage from the town of Mankato to Lovewell Reservoir.

The largest hail reported was the size of ping pong balls and golf balls in the town of Cowles. Between 5 and 6 PM CST, a squall line formed from Highway 136 in Webster county down into north central Kansas. The northern portion of this line became a small-scale bow echo and moved northeast across Nuckolls, Thayer, and Fillmore counties. Damaging downburst winds snapped off large tree limbs in Red Cloud,  Hebron, and Bruning. Winds were measured at 64 MPH in Nelson and 65 MPH in Davenport.||In the preceding days, an east-west oriented front had become quasi-stationary from the Ohio Valley across central Nebraska to Nevada.

In the upper-levels, a subtropical high was over the Tennessee Valley and gradually moved into the Carolinas as a fairly strong shortwave trough moved out of the Northern Rockies into Northern and Central Plains. Immediately ahead of the front, temperatures were in the lower to middle 90s with dewpoints in the lower to middle 60s.

During the evening hours of Friday, scattered small clusters of multi-cell thunderstorms occurred over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The clusters over southwest Nebraska were moving to the east and the clusters over northwest Kansas were moving northeast. Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman. Other measured gusts included 58 mph at the Grand Island airport and 60 mph at the Hastings airport. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 57 mph occurred surrounding these areas and even far away from where the thunderstorms actually occurred. Winds were measured at 50 mph as far south as Red Cloud. Large tree limbs were snapped off in some spots around Grand Island and in Central City. Near the Platte River, just south of Central City, large tree limbs fell on a house and landed on top of vehicles.||These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 30 kt.||This thunderstorm event was the first of several episodes of heavy rain which led to a very wet start of September for portions of south central Nebraska. Later in the evening on this Saturday, waves of thunderstorms formed over north central Kansas and repeatedly moved northeast into south central Nebraska with the greatest persistence south and east of Hastings. These waves of heavy rain continued through the night. There was a break from heavy rain during the day Sunday, but the next episode of heavy rain moved in Sunday evening. By daybreak on Monday, September 3rd, rainfall amounts totaled 3 to 5 inches across portions of northern Franklin, southern Adams, and southern Clay counties, as well as most of Fillmore, Webster, Nuckolls, and Thayer counties. This resulted in localized flash flooding with low spots in some county roads being washed out and Highway 4 being closed between Carleton and Davenport.

The clusters over southwest Nebraska were moving to the east and the clusters over northwest Kansas were moving northeast. Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman.

Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman. Other measured gusts included 58 mph at the Grand Island airport and 60 mph at the Hastings airport. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 57 mph occurred surrounding these areas and even far away from where the thunderstorms actually occurred. Winds were measured at 50 mph as far south as Red Cloud. Large tree limbs were snapped off in some spots around Grand Island and in Central City. Near the Platte River, just south of Central City, large tree limbs fell on a house and landed on top of vehicles.||These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg.

Between 2 and 3 PM CST, the first couple storms began forming south and southwest of Hill City. Around 330 PM CST, one storm moved into southwestern Rooks county. It was joined by several other storms which continued to develop along I-70 between Wakeeney and Russell. As the Rooks county storm moved east, these storms moved north and they all merged over Osborne county. Just prior to the merger, a left-moving supercell, fresh after the split, produced hail up to the size of tennis balls near the southern border of Osborne county. After the merger, the newly-formed multicell cluster took the form of a small bow echo as it moved across Mitchell county between 5 and 6 PM CST. The mesoscale convective system produced strong downburst winds that were estimated at 60 mph over central Osborne county and measured at 66 mph over Mitchell county, just west of Beloit. While this was occurring, other cells formed over Jewell county and became severe. Before merging, the southern storm produced a measured wind gust of 78 mph in the town of Jewell, while the northern one produced spotty wind damage from the town of Mankato to Lovewell Reservoir. Tree limbs were snapped off in Mankato, at least one power pole was snapped off northeast of town, and an old county communications building suffered damage as the powerful downburst winds blew the roof off. Rain then damaged the radio equipment housed inside.||These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from Arizona to Maine and it was low in amplitude. A shortwave trough was along the New Mexico-Texas border and lifting northeast. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were near 90 with dewpoints in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were near 7.0 C/km. This resulted in MLCAPE around 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 40 kt. ||This event was one of several episodes of heavy convective rains that contributed to a very wet start to September. This event alone produced 3 to 4 inch rain amounts over parts of Osborne and Mitchell counties as scattered non-severe storms continued to develop through the night, after the severe storms had exited north central Kansas. Four-day rainfall totals ending on the morning of the 5th ranged from 3 to 6 inches over Osborne, Mitchell, and Jewell counties. The highest rainfall amounts included 6.55 at Cawker City, 5.98 at Jewell, 5.22 at Beloit, and 5.20 at Osborne.",,CSV

During the evening hours of Friday, scattered small clusters of multi-cell thunderstorms occurred over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The clusters over southwest Nebraska were moving to the east and the clusters over northwest Kansas were moving northeast. Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman. Other measured gusts included 58 mph at the Grand Island airport and 60 mph at the Hastings airport. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 57 mph occurred surrounding these areas and even far away from where the thunderstorms actually occurred. Winds were measured at 50 mph as far south as Red Cloud. Large tree limbs were snapped off in some spots around Grand Island and in Central City. Near the Platte River, just south of Central City, large tree limbs fell on a house and landed on top of vehicles.||These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 30 kt.||This thunderstorm event was the first of several episodes of heavy rain which led to a very wet start of September for portions of south central Nebraska. Later in the evening on this Saturday, waves of thunderstorms formed over north central Kansas and repeatedly moved northeast into south central Nebraska with the greatest persistence south and east of Hastings. These waves of heavy rain continued through the night. There was a break from heavy rain during the day Sunday, but the next episode of heavy rain moved in Sunday evening. By daybreak on Monday, September 3rd, rainfall amounts totaled 3 to 5 inches across portions of northern Franklin, southern Adams, and southern Clay counties, as well as most of Fillmore, Webster, Nuckolls, and Thayer counties. This resulted in localized flash flooding with low spots in some county roads being washed out and Highway 4 being closed between Carleton and Davenport. As water drained into the headwaters of the Little Blue River, the river rapidly rose with minor flooding occurring. At Deweese, the river gauge peaked at 10.86 ft during the day Monday. Flood Stage is 10.0 ft.","Heavy rain across the area, ranging anywhere from 3 to 6 inches, resulted in a few rural roads being washed out in the Holstein area.

Throughout the morning and early afternoon, a narrow band of light rain, oriented from southwest-northeast, moved from the Nebraska panhandle eastward. By mid-afternoon, this rain band moved into south central Nebraska. About 60 miles ahead of this rain band, scattered thunderstorms began forming, where skies were sunny, from Red Cloud to York. These storms were part of a much larger line that extended from Souix Falls, South Dakota to Hill City, Kansas. Thunderstorms continued to increase in coverage, filling-in between Red Cloud and York. Between 4 and 6 PM CST, some storms became severe. While the majority of storms were still predominantly individual cells, hail occurred in a couple spots over Clay and Webster counties. The largest hail reported was the size of ping pong balls and golf balls in the town of Cowles. Between 5 and 6 PM CST, a squall line formed from Highway 136 in Webster county down into north central Kansas. The northern portion of this line became a small-scale bow echo and moved northeast across Nuckolls, Thayer, and Fillmore counties. Damaging downburst winds snapped off large tree limbs in Red Cloud,  Hebron, and Bruning. Winds were measured at 64 MPH in Nelson and 65 MPH in Davenport.||In the preceding days, an east-west oriented front had become quasi-stationary from the Ohio Valley across central Nebraska to Nevada. During the morning hours on this date, a low formed on the front between North Platte and McCook. This low then accelerated to near Sioux City, Iowa by mid-afternoon with its trailing cold front becoming mobile and moving southeast. The storms formed along this front. In the upper-levels, a subtropical high was over the Tennessee Valley and gradually moved into the Carolinas as a fairly strong shortwave trough moved out of the Northern Rockies into Northern and Central Plains. Immediately ahead of the front, temperatures were in the lower to middle 90s with dewpoints in the lower to middle 60s. Combined with mid-level lapse rates between 7.0 and 7.5 C/km, SBCAPE was between 1500 and 2000 J/kg.

At the surface, a weak warm front stretched west-to-east along the Nebraska-Kansas border, attendant to a low pressure center in northwest KS.

Four of the five tanks were destroyed in the fire, which produced a plume of dark black smoke that could be seen for miles. Prior to sparking the fire, this storm cluster yielded a slightly sub-severe wind gust of 55 MPH at the Holdrege airport and a report of penny size hail in Wilcox. ||Timing-wise, this convective cluster first entered South Central Nebraska between 4:30-5:30 a.m. CDT, dropping southward into eastern Dawson/western Buffalo counties. Over the next few hours, storms continued nearly due-south before exiting into north central Kansas between 8-9 a.m. CDT.

This hail occurred early-on in the evolution of the severe storm cluster, which was in the process of rapidly intensifying as several weaker storms merged. This intensification took place 1-2 hours after the leading edge of initially-disorganized convection entered the far western counties of South Central Nebraska between 10-11 p.m. CST. These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. However, deep layer shear was modest, only around 30 knots.",,CSV

This tornado (spawned by the eastern supercell) touched down in northwestern York County around 7:45 p.m. CDT and tracked east-southeast for less than 2 miles, causing minor damage to a home while also damaging several grain bins and snapping a few large trees. The largest hail reports (2) originated from the Bradshaw and Alda areas. In addition, golf ball size hail occurred near Benedict and Waco, and much of the city of York saw a few minutes of hail to at least half dollar size. As for thunderstorm winds, the highest measured gust was 60 MPH at the York airport. However, especially the eastern supercell produced a concentrated swath of damaging winds, estimated to around 75 MPH in some places. Crop damage (from a combo of both hail/wind) was extensive along this storm's track from central Merrick County into northeastern Hamilton County and northwestern-through-east-central York County. ||Taking a closer look at event evolution/timing, a smattering of weak, elevated storms got underway as early as early-mid afternoon across various parts of the 24-county area, producing little more than brief downpours and small hail. By late afternoon, another round of fairly weak storms flared up within counties mainly north of Interstate 80. However, between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, the situation escalated as one of these initially-weak storms rapidly became severe over Howard County, becoming a legitimate supercell as it tracked east-southeast through parts of Merrick-northeastern Hamilton and York counties. This storm yielded the majority of local severe weather reports/damage (including the York County tornado), before exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after 8:30 p.m. CDT. Meanwhile, back to the west, another supercell initiated over far northeastern Buffalo County around 8 p.m. CDT. Like its predecessor, it also tracked east-southeast for a few hours,  producing large hail in the Alda and Stockham areas before weakening over northern Fillmore County around 10 p.m. CDT. Thereafter, non-severe storms continued percolating well into the night within areas mainly south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281, with all of South Central Nebraska finally storm-free by 3 a.m. CDT on the 7th. ||In hindsight, this was actually a decent setup for supercell storm development. However, right up until the early evening hours, locations as far north as Merrick/York counties seemed somewhat unfavorable for higher-end severe potential, especially given that the primary west-east oriented surface front resided well to the south over northern Kansas.

By late afternoon, another round of fairly weak storms flared up within counties mainly north of Interstate 80. However, between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, the situation escalated as one of these initially-weak storms rapidly became severe over Howard County, becoming a legitimate supercell as it tracked east-southeast through parts of Merrick-northeastern Hamilton and York counties. This storm yielded the majority of local severe weather reports/damage (including the York County tornado), before exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after 8:30 p.m. CDT. Meanwhile, back to the west, another supercell initiated over far northeastern Buffalo County around 8 p.m. CDT. Like its predecessor, it also tracked east-southeast for a few hours,  producing large hail in the Alda and Stockham areas before weakening over northern Fillmore County around 10 p.m. CDT. Thereafter, non-severe storms continued percolating well into the night within areas mainly south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281, with all of South Central Nebraska finally storm-free by 3 a.m. CDT on the 7th. ||In hindsight, this was actually a decent setup for supercell storm development. However, right up until the early evening hours, locations as far north as Merrick/York counties seemed somewhat unfavorable for higher-end severe potential, especially given that the primary west-east oriented surface front resided well to the south over northern Kansas. However, even in the post-frontal airmass over South Central Nebraska, the combo of afternoon high temperatures into the 80s F and dewpoints in the upper 60s-low 70s F promoted mixed-layer CAPE around 2000 J/kg. This healthy instability, in tandem with seasonably-strong deep-layer wind shear of 40-50 knots and modest forcing provided by a shortwave trough invading from the northwest, proved plenty-sufficient to support a few supercells.",,CSV

This healthy instability, in tandem with seasonably-strong deep-layer wind shear of 40-50 knots and modest forcing provided by a shortwave trough invading from the northwest, proved plenty-sufficient to support a few supercells.","This brief EF-1 tornado occurred in northwest York County, causing damage approximately 7 miles north of Bradshaw. A home was damaged, mainly to soffits and garage doors, and there was also some roof damage. Grain bins were damaged along with several trees. Some larger cedar trees were snapped 2-3 feet above ground. Two irrigation pivots were damaged along the path. Peak winds were estimated to be 90 MPH.||This tornado was associated with a supercell and a much larger scale wind and hail event in the region. There were numerous irrigation pivots overturned or damaged, and crop damage was widespread, especially around and just to the east of the tornado path. Some soybean fields were stripped and beat to the ground, and corn fields were cut down by the wind and hail to only three feet tall in spots.",CSV

Most notably, around 7:45 a.m. CDT, a suspected lightning strike ignited a fire at a small oil storage tank facility near the Franklin-Harlan County line north of Naponee. Four of the five tanks were destroyed in the fire, which produced a plume of dark black smoke that could be seen for miles. Prior to sparking the fire, this storm cluster yielded a slightly sub-severe wind gust of 55 MPH at the Holdrege airport and a report of penny size hail in Wilcox. ||Timing-wise, this convective cluster first entered South Central Nebraska between 4:30-5:30 a.m. CDT, dropping southward into eastern Dawson/western Buffalo counties. Over the next few hours, storms continued nearly due-south before exiting into north central Kansas between 8-9 a.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, this activity was sparked by a series of weak disturbances passing southward through the region in northwesterly flow, directed between a large-scale trough centered over eastern Canada/the Great Lakes, and a trough over the southwestern United States. Mesoscale convective parameters over the local area featured around 1500 J/kg of most-unstable CAPE, but no more than 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.","There was a lightning strike to an area of oil storage tanks, resulting in a fire. This fire destroyed 4 of the 5 storage tanks located at the facility. The time was estimated from radar data.",CSV

At noon CST, an area of scattered thunderstorms moved into north central Kansas. The area of storms was leftover from previous afternoon and nighttime convection and was associated with an advancing outflow boundary. By this time, new thunderstorms were beginning to form over north central Kansas as well. A quasi-stationary line of thunderstorms formed from southwest to northeast across Phillips and Rooks counties between noon and 4 PM CST. This line fell apart, but one last storm moved into Rooks County by 5 PM CST and weakened as it moved into southeastern Phillips County by 6 PM CST. Severe hail occurred in a couple spots around 1 PM CST. Hail the size of pennies fell just north of the town of Speed, and hail the size of quarters fell near the Phillips-Smith County line north of Agra. The final storm that weakened over Phillips County produced winds up to 70 mph near the town of Glade. The echo-training resulted in heavy rainfall amounts between 3 and 4 inches from western Rooks into central Phillips counties. Meanwhile, an area of 4-8 inches of rain fell over Gove, Graham, and Trego counties, with the highest observation of 9.88 inches measured in southwestern Graham County. As all this water drained into the South Fork of the Solomon River and Bow Creek, along with their tributaries, water levels shot up rapidly during the evening, with flooding occurring in crop and pasture land adjacent to these features. The South Fork of the Solomon River west of the Webster Reservoir rose into moderate flood stage and crested at 13.56 ft around 6 AM CST Tuesday (flood stage is 8.5 ft). Bow Creek near Stockton rose into minor flood stage and crested at 10.55 ft late Tuesday morning (flood stage is 9.0 ft). Just downstream from the river gauge, water from Bow Creek was flowing over the bridge near east 500 Rd and Day Dream Rd. ||Scattered thunderstorms developed well to the west during the previous afternoon and night, along and ahead of a cold front. The resulting MCS sent an outflow boundary across north central Kansas, which aided in initiating new storms. A persistent trough was over the Western U.S. with an embedded cut-off low, with a downstream ridge over the Upper Midwest. Fairly weak southwest flow was over the Central Plains. In advance of the storms, temperatures had risen into the 80s with dewpoints in the 60s. Combined with mid-level lapse rates near 7.5 C/km, this resulted in MLCAPE between 2500 and 3000 J/kg.

At noon CST, an area of scattered thunderstorms moved into north central Kansas. The area of storms was leftover from previous afternoon and nighttime convection and was associated with an advancing outflow boundary. By this time, new thunderstorms were beginning to form over north central Kansas as well. A quasi-stationary line of thunderstorms formed from southwest to northeast across Phillips and Rooks counties between noon and 4 PM CST. This line fell apart, but one last storm moved into Rooks County by 5 PM CST and weakened as it moved into southeastern Phillips County by 6 PM CST. Severe hail occurred in a couple spots around 1 PM CST. Hail the size of pennies fell just north of the town of Speed, and hail the size of quarters fell near the Phillips-Smith County line north of Agra. The final storm that weakened over Phillips County produced winds up to 70 mph near the town of Glade. The echo-training resulted in heavy rainfall amounts between 3 and 4 inches from western Rooks into central Phillips counties. Meanwhile, an area of 4-8 inches of rain fell over Gove, Graham, and Trego counties, with the highest observation of 9.88 inches measured in southwestern Graham County. As all this water drained into the South Fork of the Solomon River and Bow Creek, along with their tributaries, water levels shot up rapidly during the evening, with flooding occurring in crop and pasture land adjacent to these features. The South Fork of the Solomon River west of the Webster Reservoir rose into moderate flood stage and crested at 13.56 ft around 6 AM CST Tuesday (flood stage is 8.5 ft). Bow Creek near Stockton rose into minor flood stage and crested at 10.55 ft late Tuesday morning (flood stage is 9.0 ft). Just downstream from the river gauge, water from Bow Creek was flowing over the bridge near east 500 Rd and Day Dream Rd. ||Scattered thunderstorms developed well to the west during the previous afternoon and night, along and ahead of a cold front.

Around 4 PM CST, thunderstorms began forming over Rooks County and, by 5 PM, storm mergers resulted in the formation of a short line segment that extended from southwest to northeast. As this line expanded into Osborne County, other scattered storms formed over Smith, Jewell, and Mitchell counties. These storms joined others over central Kansas, as an MCS developed and a common cold pool formed. The large line of storms that evolved exited Smith, Jewell, and Mitchell counties by 7 PM. As a result, the initial line segment of storms rapidly weakened. The new line became severe over parts of Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell counties, producing hail up to the size of ping pong balls along with high winds. Power lines were knocked down in Cawker City. Minor street flooding was reported in Beloit where an automated mesonet station measured 2.48 inches of rain in an hour and 15 minutes.||Weak flow was over the United States as the polar jet stream was unusually far to the north over Canada. A slow-moving cut-off low was over western South Dakota. During the day, a shortwave trough south of the low moved from Colorado into the Central Plains. A ridge was over the Great Lakes with another cut-off low over the Gulf Coast. The pressure pattern at the surface was extremely weak over the Central Plains. Just prior to thunderstorm development, temperatures were in the lower 80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were 7-7.5 C/km, but MLCAPE was only 1000-1500 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 40 kts due to a strong upper-level jet streak accompanying the trough.","A mesonet recorded 2.48 inches of rain, with most falling in 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Among various other impacts, Interstate 80 was initially closed from Lexington westward to North Platte, but with this closure eventually creeping as far east as Grand Island to accommodate traffic back-up. There was a fairly sharp divide in snow totals and storm impacts across the area, as locations generally northwest of an Alma-Kearney-Fullerton line received the highest amounts of 4-9, and in turn, experienced the most severe blizzard conditions. Amounts dropped off steadily to the southeast of that line, with places such as Osceola, Grand Island, Hastings and Red Cloud only seeing 1-2. Even farther southeast, counties such as Thayer/Fillmore/Nuckolls barely received a dusting. Per NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest official totals featured: 8.5 in Greeley, 8 in Edison, 7.9 in Loup City, 7.2 six miles southeast of Lexington and 7 in Arcadia, Cambridge and Wilsonville. In the Tri Cities, Kearney led the way with 3.8, while Grand Island and Hastings only measured 1.9. Winds were certainly a major factor, as much of the 27th featured sustained north-northwest speeds of 25-35 MPH and frequent gusts of 40-50 MPH, resulting in considerable blowing/drifting snow and reducing visibilities to around 1/4 mile for several hours in the Blizzard Warning area. ||Breaking down event timing, and initially backing up a bit, this storm started off very similar to the one four weeks prior, and with something fairly unusual for this time of year: soaking winter rain! In fact, Wednesday the 26th featured widespread rainfall of 1-2, including daily records in Grand Island (1.42) and Hastings (1.41). As colder air invaded western counties late that night, rain quickly changed to snow, with blizzard conditions already in full force by sunrise on the 27th in places such as Kearney, Lexington and Ord. Even before snow impacts kicked into high gear, the initially rain-wettened roads became slick due to a flash freeze in the falling temperatures. For the hardest-hit northern/western counties, the bulk of snow occurred during the early-mid morning, while areas farther south/east nearer the Highway 281 corridor (including Grand Island/Hastings) observed the majority of snow and occasional white-out conditions during the late-morning through mid-afternoon. Although blowing/drifting snow persisted in many areas well into the night, South Central Nebraska saw a pronounced break from falling snow through the late afternoon-evening, before one last batch of light snow (accumulation largely under one-half inch) flared up on the morning of the 28th.

While this was not a true blizzard by any means, occasional visibility reductions to one-half mile or less were noted, especially on the afternoon and evening of the 1st, when sustained north winds of 20-25 MPH and frequent gusts of 30-40 MPH were most prevalent. ||Backing up in time a bit, snow was not the only story associated with this long-duration event, as it actually started off as a significant late-autumn rain-producer. In fact, most of the six-county area measured 1-2 of soaking rain between the afternoon of Nov. 30th and the morning of the 1st, before precipitation finally switched over to snow. Due in part to much of the initial precipitation falling as rain, along with the fact that a significant batch of mid-level dry air got wrapped into the heart of the parent low pressure system, snowfall totals in most of the area fell short of expectations (many places received at least a few inches less than originally forecasted). In the mid-upper levels, the main driving force was a strong, slow-moving low pressure system that tracked from south central KS on the morning of the 1st to the IA/MO border area by the morning of the 2nd before weakening and shearing-out eastward into the Midwest. The intermittent areas of snow that persisted across the local area through most of the 1st-2nd were supported by weaker lobes of energy rotating around the backside of the parent system.

Per CoCoRaHS and NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest official totals featured: 3.2 six miles east of Phillipsburg, 3.1 four miles west-northwest of Plainville and 3.0 at Natoma and Covert. Despite snow amounts staying fairly tame, most places endured at least a few hours of reduced visibility thanks to sustained north winds averaging 10-20 MPH and gusting to around 30 MPH. Climatologically, this was clearly an unusually-early snow event. As just one example: this was the 2nd-earliest snowfall of 3+ inches on record at Natoma. ||Timing-wise, this was a somewhat split event. While most areas received at least some snow during the morning and early afternoon hours mainly between 7 a.m-1 p.m. CDT (especially the northern three counties), the southern three counties picked up the majority of snow during a secondary band that developed during the late afternoon and evening, mainly between 4-10 p.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, the large scale regime featured a broad trough sinking southward into the central United States, anchored by a closed low tracking through the Manitoba-North Dakota-Minnesota border region. However, on the smaller scale, the driving force locally was a pronounced ribbon of mid-level frontogenesis (especially evident at 700 millibars), promoting mesoscale banding. At the surface, the gusty north winds were driven by an enhanced pressure gradient between a seasonably-strong cold front that bisected Kansas from southwest-to-northeast at daybreak, and a strong high pressure system (around 1034 millibars) centered over the Northern Rockies. The overall-strongest winds occurred during the morning, slowly letting up through the afternoon and evening. Temperature-wise, this event served as the grand finale to a markedly-cold start to October; in fact, most of the area endured a Top-3 coldest first half of the month.

Starting around 4 p.m. CDT in far northern local counties (such as Valley/Greeley) and reaching the Kansas border area by 7 p.m. CDT, most places observed at least a one-to-two hour period of sustained north-northwest winds generally 25-40 MPH and frequent gusts at least 40-50 MPH.

Hastings airport fell just shy of severe-criteria with a peak gust of 56 MPH. While there were no significant damage reports, small tree limbs were reported down in Ord (this likely occurred in other places as well). ||As for the meteorological setup, and starting with the mid levels, a vigorous shortwave trough passed well north of the local area, tracking from ND to MN. However, pronounced pressure rises accompanied the associated surface cold front into Nebraska, featuring a bullseye of two-hour rises between 4-6 millibars, emanating from an expansive high centered over eastern MT. The combination of these notable pressure rises into a deeply-mixed afternoon boundary layer proved more than sufficient to whip up the intense winds. In addition to the winds, this cold front was also  responsible for a drastic 24-hour temperature change. Afternoon highs across South Central Nebraska on the 3rd (just ahead of this front) soared to record/near-record values in the upper-80s to mid-90s F. However, daytime highs on the 4th were a remarkable 45-55 degrees colder, only reaching the upper-30s to mid-40s in most counties.","A wind gust of 62 mph occurred at Evelyn Sharp Field in Ord, behind a strong cold front.",CSV

That being said, for most of the 24 local counties, totals were fairly minimal...no more than 1-2. The notable exception focused south-southeast of a line from Ayr-Harvard-Gresham, where amounts of at least 3-5 were common. Within that broader primary snow zone , a roughly 10-20 mile wide swath piled up as much as 5-7, primarily within the following counties: most of Fillmore, northern Thayer, northeastern Nuckolls, southeastern Clay and southeastern York. Per CoCoRaHS and NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest official totals featured: 7 in Geneva, 6.8 four miles south of Shickley, 5 six miles east-southeast of Clay Center and 4.6 in Hebron. Unofficial totals (including social media reports) included 6.6 in Milligan, 6.5 in Fairmont, 5 at Waco and 4.5 seven miles northeast of Superior. While only a small percentage of South Central Nebraska observed these highest totals, many counties endured at least a few hours of reduced visibility, and even brief near-blizzard conditions, thanks to sustained north winds averaging 15-25 MPH and gusting up to around 35 MPH. Climatologically, this was clearly an unusually-early snow event. As just a few examples: Geneva had its 2nd-earliest snowfall of 5+ inches on record (and the most significant early-season snow since 1970), and Hastings reported its 4th-earliest snowfall of 1+ inches. ||Timing-wise, this was a fairly quick-hitter, with most areas tallying the brunt of accumulation within a 4-8 hour period, starting in most counties between 6-8 a.m. CDT and largely ending from southwest-to-northeast during the 1-5 p.m. CDT time frame. In the mid-upper levels, the large scale regime featured a broad trough sinking southward into the central United States, anchored by a closed low tracking through the Manitoba-North Dakota-Minnesota border region. However, on the smaller scale, the driving force locally was a pronounced ribbon of mid-level frontogenesis (especially evident at 700 millibars). This resulted in mesoscale banding, and the aforementioned higher-than-expected snow totals centered over the Fillmore County area. At the surface, the gusty north winds were driven by an enhanced pressure gradient between a seasonably-strong cold front that bisected Kansas from southwest-to-northeast at daybreak, and a strong high pressure system (around 1034 millibars) centered over the Northern Rockies. The overall-strongest winds occurred during the morning, slowly letting up through the afternoon and evening. Temperature-wise, this event served as the grand finale to a markedly-cold start to October; in fact, most of the area endured a Top-5 coldest first half of the month. However, just two days later on the 16th temperatures soared into the upper 60s to around 70, quickly melting this early-season snow into a memory.","Snow totals across Adams County ranged from as little as 1-2 in northern areas (including 1.1 at the NWS Hastings office), up to around 4 in southern areas (including an NWS employee's residence near Pauline).

Saturday afternoon, a narrow band of snow developed, in the shape of an arc, from Omaha through the Sandhills and then southwest to Denver. This band formed in the deformation zone of developing low pressure. During the evening, this band expanded and moved southeast, enveloping all of south central Nebraska. At 2 AM CST Sunday, the northern terminus of the snow shield began moving into south central Nebraska. By 7 AM CST, the snow had ended over most of the area, except to the south and east of Hastings. By noon, the snow had exited to the east, bringing an end to the snow there as well. Windy conditions maintained blowing snow for 3 to 5 hours after the snow ended. Widespread, frequent wind gusts between 35 and 50 mph were common, which severely reduced the visibility in falling and blowing snow, especially south and east of Hastings. Near zero visibility was reported at Clay Center, Geneva, Hebron, and Nelson. A couple locations recorded wind gusts above 50 mph, including 55 mph at Hastings, and 62 mph at Nelson. The strength of the winds resulted in scattered power outages in Phelps, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. State troopers and other first responders were busy responding to slide-offs and minor accidents due to slippery roads. Motorists were urged to avoid traveling, and many spent the night in hotels. One hotel mentioned that travelers were checking-in all night, and others that intended to travel to the region had cancelled their reservations. Despite the nasty conditions, the Grand Island and Kearney airports remained open. However, numerous churches cancelled services. A few schools in Webster, Nuckolls, and Thayer counties even delayed their start time Monday morning. Measuring the snowfall was extremely difficult due to the wind. Most locations estimated 1 to 3 inches of snow fell. The exception was southeast of Hastings where Shickley estimated 3.5 inches, Clay Center estimated 4, and Hubbell estimated 6.||During the daytime hours Saturday, an Arctic cold front advanced south across Nebraska. A separate low pressure system moved through Wyoming and Colorado into southwest Kansas. This low and its associated fronts moved east along the Kansas-Oklahoma border Saturday night while the Arctic front continued moving south in its wake.
