This snowfall was associated with a weak and non-strengthening short-wave trough. So, the radar presentation of this event was disorganized. Small patches of light snow began developing from Colorado into Kansas and southern Nebraska during the morning hours. Due to dry low-level air, it took several hours for precipitation to reach the ground on a consistent basis. By midday, a relatively well-organized area of light snow had formed over northwest Kansas and southwest Nebraska. This area moved east-northeast across south central Nebraska during the mid-to-late afternoon. Despite the cloud cover, temperatures had climbed into the low 40s east of Hwy 183, before precipitation began falling. That allowed for some light rain to fall in some areas before the column rapidly cooled, resulting in a changeover to snow. During the daylight hours, the only areas where measurable snow fell were southwest and west of Grand Island, with between 1 and 2 inches of accumulation on grassy areas. Elsewhere, actual air temperature and ground temperature allowed the snow to melt on contact. That area of snow moved into eastern Nebraska by sunset, but in its wake, more patchy areas of snow continued to develop  through the evening. After sunset, snow began accumulating across the rest of the area. By midnight, a fairly large but unorganized area of precipitation enveloped much of the Central Plains, extending from southern South Dakota to Oklahoma. Across south central Nebraska, the snow did fill-in after midnight, becoming steadier, but with diminishing intensity. The snow ended across the area by 8 AM Saturday.

A few weak thunderstorms began forming around 1230 PM CST, with two small clusters over Harlan and Clay counties. Other showers and thunderstorms developed south of Interstate 80, and by mid-afternoon, they had moved across and to the north of the Interstate. A couple of these storms became severe and produced large amounts of hail (the freezing level was around 8,000 ft AGL). One storm turned severe from northwest Kearney county into south-central Buffalo county, where hail up to the size of ping pong balls occurred, including in the southwest part of the city of Kearney. There was a narrow swath of Interstate 80 that was covered with hail, and snowplows needed to be deployed. The other severe storm tracked from near Edgar to McCool Junction, where it also produced hail up to the size of ping pong balls. The thunderstorm activity ended by late afternoon. These storms were elevated, on the cold side of a strong cold front. As the colder temperatures near-surface moved in, and lapse rates steepened, north winds increased to 30 to 35 mph, with frequent gusts between 45 and 55 mph. There were a few higher wind gusts, including 63 mph at the Lexington airport, which was the highest gust recorded, 59 mph near Odessa, and 58 mph at Cozad and Hastings. Late in the afternoon, the thunderstorms weakened into showers which eventually morphed into stratiform rain as they encountered stability. This rain moved into increasingly colder air where it changed to snow north of a line from Lexington to Fullerton. One to 5 inches of snow fell, with most areas measuring 1 to 3 inches. The highest amounts were 5 inches near Scotia, 4 inches near Johnson Lake, with 3 inches at Greeley and Ord. Snow began accumulating during the late afternoon, and continued through the evening hours. The snow rapidly dissipated just after midnight CST.||At sunrise, a 1000 mb low pressure system was over southeast Colorado, with a warm front extending east across northern Kansas. A stationary Arctic front was over the northern Rockies and Plains. During the day, the stationary front become mobile and accelerated southward, merging with the occluded low and its fronts. The forward momentum of the Arctic air shoved the combined front south, also forcing the Colorado low to weaken as it migrated along the front into central Kansas. In the upper-levels, the longwave pattern was typical of the mean flow that had stubbornly prevailed since the middle of November. The flow over North America was split, with a trough over the western U.S. and a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. The flow was from the southwest over the Central Plains, with a potent, intensifying shortwave trough over Colorado and New Mexico during the morning. By sunset, a small closed low had formed along the Nebraska-Kansas border. Due to the confluence of the northern and southern streams, the low quickly dissipated and, by Friday morning, all that was left was a modest shortwave trough over Wisconsin and Illinois.",,CSV

One storm turned severe from northwest Kearney county into south-central Buffalo county, where hail up to the size of ping pong balls occurred, including in the southwest part of the city of Kearney. There was a narrow swath of Interstate 80 that was covered with hail, and snowplows needed to be deployed. The other severe storm tracked from near Edgar to McCool Junction, where it also produced hail up to the size of ping pong balls. The thunderstorm activity ended by late afternoon. These storms were elevated, on the cold side of a strong cold front. As the colder temperatures near-surface moved in, and lapse rates steepened, north winds increased to 30 to 35 mph, with frequent gusts between 45 and 55 mph. There were a few higher wind gusts, including 63 mph at the Lexington airport, which was the highest gust recorded, 59 mph near Odessa, and 58 mph at Cozad and Hastings. Late in the afternoon, the thunderstorms weakened into showers which eventually morphed into stratiform rain as they encountered stability. This rain moved into increasingly colder air where it changed to snow north of a line from Lexington to Fullerton. One to 5 inches of snow fell, with most areas measuring 1 to 3 inches. The highest amounts were 5 inches near Scotia, 4 inches near Johnson Lake, with 3 inches at Greeley and Ord. Snow began accumulating during the late afternoon, and continued through the evening hours. The snow rapidly dissipated just after midnight CST.||At sunrise, a 1000 mb low pressure system was over southeast Colorado, with a warm front extending east across northern Kansas. A stationary Arctic front was over the northern Rockies and Plains. During the day, the stationary front become mobile and accelerated southward, merging with the occluded low and its fronts. The forward momentum of the Arctic air shoved the combined front south, also forcing the Colorado low to weaken as it migrated along the front into central Kansas. In the upper-levels, the longwave pattern was typical of the mean flow that had stubbornly prevailed since the middle of November. The flow over North America was split, with a trough over the western U.S. and a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico.

A few weak thunderstorms began forming around 1230 PM CST, with two small clusters over Harlan and Clay counties. Other showers and thunderstorms developed south of Interstate 80, and by mid-afternoon, they had moved across and to the north of the Interstate. A couple of these storms became severe and produced large amounts of hail (the freezing level was around 8,000 ft AGL). One storm turned severe from northwest Kearney county into south-central Buffalo county, where hail up to the size of ping pong balls occurred, including in the southwest part of the city of Kearney. There was a narrow swath of Interstate 80 that was covered with hail, and snowplows needed to be deployed. The other severe storm tracked from near Edgar to McCool Junction, where it also produced hail up to the size of ping pong balls. The thunderstorm activity ended by late afternoon. These storms were elevated, on the cold side of a strong cold front. As the colder temperatures near-surface moved in, and lapse rates steepened, north winds increased to 30 to 35 mph, with frequent gusts between 45 and 55 mph. There were a few higher wind gusts, including 63 mph at the Lexington airport, which was the highest gust recorded, 59 mph near Odessa, and 58 mph at Cozad and Hastings. Late in the afternoon, the thunderstorms weakened into showers which eventually morphed into stratiform rain as they encountered stability. This rain moved into increasingly colder air where it changed to snow north of a line from Lexington to Fullerton. One to 5 inches of snow fell, with most areas measuring 1 to 3 inches. The highest amounts were 5 inches near Scotia, 4 inches near Johnson Lake, with 3 inches at Greeley and Ord. Snow began accumulating during the late afternoon, and continued through the evening hours. The snow rapidly dissipated just after midnight CST.||At sunrise, a 1000 mb low pressure system was over southeast Colorado, with a warm front extending east across northern Kansas.

A few weak thunderstorms began forming around 1230 PM CST, with two small clusters over Harlan and Clay counties. Other showers and thunderstorms developed south of Interstate 80, and by mid-afternoon, they had moved across and to the north of the Interstate. A couple of these storms became severe and produced large amounts of hail (the freezing level was around 8,000 ft AGL). One storm turned severe from northwest Kearney county into south-central Buffalo county, where hail up to the size of ping pong balls occurred, including in the southwest part of the city of Kearney. There was a narrow swath of Interstate 80 that was covered with hail, and snowplows needed to be deployed. The other severe storm tracked from near Edgar to McCool Junction, where it also produced hail up to the size of ping pong balls. The thunderstorm activity ended by late afternoon. These storms were elevated, on the cold side of a strong cold front. As the colder temperatures near-surface moved in, and lapse rates steepened, north winds increased to 30 to 35 mph, with frequent gusts between 45 and 55 mph. There were a few higher wind gusts, including 63 mph at the Lexington airport, which was the highest gust recorded, 59 mph near Odessa, and 58 mph at Cozad and Hastings. Late in the afternoon, the thunderstorms weakened into showers which eventually morphed into stratiform rain as they encountered stability. This rain moved into increasingly colder air where it changed to snow north of a line from Lexington to Fullerton. One to 5 inches of snow fell, with most areas measuring 1 to 3 inches. The highest amounts were 5 inches near Scotia, 4 inches near Johnson Lake, with 3 inches at Greeley and Ord. Snow began accumulating during the late afternoon, and continued through the evening hours. The snow rapidly dissipated just after midnight CST.||At sunrise, a 1000 mb low pressure system was over southeast Colorado, with a warm front extending east across northern Kansas. A stationary Arctic front was over the northern Rockies and Plains. During the day, the stationary front become mobile and accelerated southward, merging with the occluded low and its fronts. The forward momentum of the Arctic air shoved the combined front south, also forcing the Colorado low to weaken as it migrated along the front into central Kansas. In the upper-levels, the longwave pattern was typical of the mean flow that had stubbornly prevailed since the middle of November. The flow over North America was split, with a trough over the western U.S. and a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. The flow was from the southwest over the Central Plains, with a potent, intensifying shortwave trough over Colorado and New Mexico during the morning. By sunset, a small closed low had formed along the Nebraska-Kansas border. Due to the confluence of the northern and southern streams, the low quickly dissipated and, by Friday morning, all that was left was a modest shortwave trough over Wisconsin and Illinois.",,CSV

The worst of the flooding occurred near the Crystal Lake Recreation Area in Adams County, but pockets of minor/brief flooding were noted in and around Kearney as well.||Rain first moved into the area during the early morning hours of Thursday, May 21st as a closed upper low pressure system slowly moved into the area. More persistent and heavier rain developed within a west to east band focused along the Highway 6 and Interstate 80 corridors around midday Thursday, and persisted through the late afternoon. Brief and minor flooding occurred in poor drainage areas in and around Kearney Thursday afternoon. Activity weakened and became somewhat disorganized during the evening hours, but pockets of light to moderate rain persisted through Thursday night and into Friday morning, May 22nd. The most persistent band of rain, with some embedded thunderstorms, developed around dawn on Friday and blossomed in coverage such that the entire area was seeing rainfall by noon as the upper low slowly inched its way into north central Kansas. Rainfall was efficient through the entire afternoon due to a persistent feed of moisture into the system from the southeast and very slow movement of the upper low. This led to increased runoff into area streams and rivers such that sandbagging was needed by Friday evening in Holstein due to rising river levels along the Little Blue River. Rainfall rates slowly decreased Friday evening and the upper low gained a little bit of eastward momentum as it moved into southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas. New thunderstorm development in these areas began to cut off the moisture flow into south central Nebraska, with only isolated light showers persisting into Friday night. Widespread rain amounts of 3 to 6 inches resulted in flooding along the Little Blue River, as well as the Crystal Lake Recreation Area, which led to camper evacuations. Flood damages and lost revenue totaled $10,000 for the recreation area alone. Additional damage occurred to infrastructure including Highway 74 near Ayr (which was closed for a time on Saturday, May 23rd), numerous county roads, as well as a BNSF railroad bridge just north of Crystal Lake.||Meteorologically speaking, it was somewhat unusual to have such a potent, slow-moving, and cut-off upper low pressure system so late into spring. The slow moving nature of the upper low, along with nearly stationary forcing from deformation within the northwest quadrant, were the key factors that led to such heavy rain amounts as precipitable water values were not overly high, around 1.1��� to 1.4���. Persistent cloud cover, cool surface temperatures, and weak mid level lapse rates kept instability values seasonably low, generally less than 1000 J/kg, meaning this heavy rain event was largely synoptic driven, with a lesser convective component than normally seen during late May.","Heavy rain around and upstream of this area resulted in flooding during the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Widespread amounts of 3 to 6 inches fell, with much of the flooding affecting areas along the Little Blue River. Sandbagging was required in Holstein on the evening of the 22nd due to rising waters. Flooding affected the Crystal Lake Recreation Area near Ayr. All campers were evacuated, with flooding causing damage and a loss of revenue for the holiday weekend, totaling approximately 10,000 dollars. Numerous rural roads were damaged, and Highway 74 near Ayr was closed for a period of time due to debris becoming jammed under a bridge, causing water to rise over the road. The highway reopened during the late evening hours of May 23rd. Major damage to a BNSF trestle bridge was reported north of the Crystal Lake campground due to clogged water drainage and undermining. Flooding subsided on the 24th.",CSV

While roughly the northeast half of the area (particularly Jewell/Mitchell counties) received little to no overnight accumulation, an intense/narrow mesoscale band dumped as much as 6-9 of wet snow along a northwest-southeast axis through the heart of Phillips and Osborne counties (and clipping northeast Rooks and southwest Smith counties along the way).  Amounts this high concentrated within a swath no more than 10-15 miles wide, with totals tapering off to barely a dusting only a few miles on either side. Per several official reports (NWS coop observer/CoCoRaHS) and a few unofficial ones, some of the highest totals featured: 9.2 six miles east of Phillipsburg, 8.1 in Phillipsburg, 8 at Logan and 7-9 sixteen miles south-southeast of Osborne. To the southwest of the main band, more modest amounts included 3.2 four miles west-northwest of Plainville and 2 at Natoma. Despite the hefty totals within the primary snow stripe, the fact that this was a late night/early morning event and that winds averaged only 10-15 MPH through most of it kept travel impacts somewhat in check through roughly sunrise. However, north winds picked up as the day of the 25th wore on, with frequent gusts of 25-35 MPH combining with residual light snowfall to promote some drifting and reduced visibility. ||Breaking down timing, the main event associated with the intense mesoscale band unfolded over primarily a 7-9 hour span, getting underway between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. as spotty light rain transitioned to steady snow, and weakening/gradually sinking south of the area between 7-9 a.m. In the mid-upper levels, the primary player was a potent shortwave trough diving into the Central Plains from the north-northwest, featuring a compact/intense closed circulation that peaked in intensity while traversing the local area (especially evident at 700 millibars). As the already-strong zone of deep convergence/frontogenesis intercepted a pocket of steep mid-level lapse rates, the pronounced mesoscale band blossomed, starting out oriented predominantly north-south but gradually pivoting considerably more northwest-southeast in response to the movement of the parent system. At the surface, the relatively light breezes through the night resulted from the region temporarily residing within the heart of an inverted trough axis, before this boundary slipped south around sunrise and allowed stronger northerly winds to kick in. Temperature-wise, the wet nature of snow resulted from overnight readings holding up mainly in the low 30s F. From a forecast perspective this was a challenging event, as although it became increasingly evident 24-48 hours out that mesoscale banding might ensue, its eventual placement/intensity remained a major question mark until it materialized on radar.

While the majority of the 24-county area (including the Tri Cities) received little to no overnight accumulation, an intense/narrow mesoscale band dumped as much as 6-10 of wet snow on portions of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas and southwestern Harlan counties. Amounts this high concentrated within a swath no more than 10-15 miles wide, with totals tapering off to barely a dusting only a few miles on either side. Per several official reports (NWS coop observer/CoCoRaHS) and a few unofficial ones, some of the highest totals featured: 10 in Elwood, 9 nine miles north of Edison, 8 in Edison, 6-8 at Beaver City and 7.1 six miles southwest of Lexington. On the periphery of the main band, more modest amounts included: 4.5 in Cozad, 4 at Gothenburg and 3 in Cambridge. Despite the hefty totals within the primary snow stripe, the fact that this was a late night/early morning event and that winds averaged only 10-15 MPH through most of it kept travel impacts somewhat in check through roughly sunrise. However, north winds picked up as the day of the 25th wore on, with frequent gusts of 25-35 MPH combining with residual light snowfall to promote some drifting and reduced visibility. ||Breaking down timing, the main event associated with the intense mesoscale band unfolded over primarily a 7-9 hour span, getting underway between 10 p.m. and midnight as spotty light rain transitioned to steady snow, and weakening/gradually sinking southward into Kansas between 5-7 a.m. In the mid-upper levels, the primary player was a potent shortwave trough diving into the Central Plains from the north-northwest, featuring a compact/intense closed circulation that peaked in intensity while traversing the local area (especially evident at 700 millibars). As the already-strong zone of deep convergence/frontogenesis intercepted a pocket of steep mid-level lapse rates, the pronounced mesoscale band blossomed, starting out oriented predominantly north-south but gradually pivoting more northwest-southeast in response to the movement of the parent system. At the surface, the relatively light breezes through the night resulted from the region temporarily residing within the heart of an inverted trough axis, before this boundary slipped south around sunrise and allowed stronger northerly winds to kick in. Temperature-wise, the wet nature of snow resulted from overnight readings holding up mainly in the low 30s F. From a forecast perspective this was a challenging event, as although it became increasingly evident 24-48 hours out that mesoscale banding might ensue, its eventual placement/intensity remained a major question mark until it materialized on radar. In the end, although forecasted maximum snow amounts proved to be significantly under-done, a good chance for at least 2-4 within the broader general area became apparent by the afternoon of the 24th, prompting the issuance of a Winter Weather Advisory.","Storm total snowfall reports generally ranged from an inch or 2 across the eastern half of the county, with higher amounts of 4-8 inches across the western half of the county. Reported totals included 7.1 inches six miles southwest of Lexington, 6.1 inches four miles south of Cozad, 4.5 inches in Cozad and 4 inches at Gothenburg.",CSV

While the majority of the 24-county area (including the Tri Cities) received little to no overnight accumulation, an intense/narrow mesoscale band dumped as much as 6-10 of wet snow on portions of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas and southwestern Harlan counties. Amounts this high concentrated within a swath no more than 10-15 miles wide, with totals tapering off to barely a dusting only a few miles on either side. Per several official reports (NWS coop observer/CoCoRaHS) and a few unofficial ones, some of the highest totals featured: 10 in Elwood, 9 nine miles north of Edison, 8 in Edison, 6-8 at Beaver City and 7.1 six miles southwest of Lexington. On the periphery of the main band, more modest amounts included: 4.5 in Cozad, 4 at Gothenburg and 3 in Cambridge. Despite the hefty totals within the primary snow stripe, the fact that this was a late night/early morning event and that winds averaged only 10-15 MPH through most of it kept travel impacts somewhat in check through roughly sunrise. However, north winds picked up as the day of the 25th wore on, with frequent gusts of 25-35 MPH combining with residual light snowfall to promote some drifting and reduced visibility. ||Breaking down timing, the main event associated with the intense mesoscale band unfolded over primarily a 7-9 hour span, getting underway between 10 p.m. and midnight as spotty light rain transitioned to steady snow, and weakening/gradually sinking southward into Kansas between 5-7 a.m. In the mid-upper levels, the primary player was a potent shortwave trough diving into the Central Plains from the north-northwest, featuring a compact/intense closed circulation that peaked in intensity while traversing the local area (especially evident at 700 millibars). As the already-strong zone of deep convergence/frontogenesis intercepted a pocket of steep mid-level lapse rates, the pronounced mesoscale band blossomed, starting out oriented predominantly north-south but gradually pivoting more northwest-southeast in response to the movement of the parent system. At the surface, the relatively light breezes through the night resulted from the region temporarily residing within the heart of an inverted trough axis, before this boundary slipped south around sunrise and allowed stronger northerly winds to kick in. Temperature-wise, the wet nature of snow resulted from overnight readings holding up mainly in the low 30s F. From a forecast perspective this was a challenging event, as although it became increasingly evident 24-48 hours out that mesoscale banding might ensue, its eventual placement/intensity remained a major question mark until it materialized on radar. In the end, although forecasted maximum snow amounts proved to be significantly under-done, a good chance for at least 2-4 within the broader general area became apparent by the afternoon of the 24th, prompting the issuance of a Winter Weather Advisory.","The highest storm total snowfall amounts ranged from 6 to 10 inches, falling in a narrow 10-15 mile wide corridor running from north-northwest to southeast through the heart of the county.

One of these weak thundershowers managed to spawn a landspout tornado a few miles west of Davenport, NE, in extreme northeastern portions of Nuckolls County. This landspout, unlike most, did cause some damage as nearly a dozen empty coal railroad cars were overturned. The aforementioned line of thunderstorms strengthened slightly during the evening, per radar reflectivity, before weakening with loss of daytime heating around sunset.

Numerous county roads became submerged in water and impassable late Sunday night into early Monday morning.

The rescue had to be done via air boat because so many roads in the area were under water and impassable. ||The heavy rain from Sunday night into Monday morning occurred over areas that were already saturated from recent heavy rains from May 21-23, and this likely contributed to the flooding impacts from this event. Very slow storm motions and seasonably high precipitable water values near 1.5��� were also meteorological factors to this heavy rain event. The tornado occurred in conditions fairly typical of landspouts as it was along a surface front with abundant ambient vorticity that was stretched into the vertical axis by steep low level lapse rates and sufficient 0-3 km CAPE near 100 J/kg.","A landspout tornado was confirmed via several eyewitness reports and a damage survey in northern Nuckolls County. This tornado formed along a weak frontal boundary and exhibited the classic landspout characteristics of a long, translucent condensation/dust funnel.

As just a few examples: the Grand Island Utilities Director called this one of the top-five worst power outage events of his career; and the Polk County Rural Power District reported at least 25 broken poles. Getting back to the weather itself, the entire day featured strong north winds, frequently gusting 40-50+ MPH. While peak gusts at official airport stations topped out slightly below severe-criteria, a few personal weather stations clocked 58 MPH, including one south of Kearney and another in Nelson. The vast majority of wintry precipitation occurred during the daytime hours, largely ending well-before sunset. Light-but-persistent freezing drizzle was the main issue, especially within the aforementioned, southwest-northeast corridor of counties that experienced the worst power outages. Most ice accretion targeted elevated surfaces (e.g. power lines), with only minimal road impacts given near-freezing surface temperatures. As for snow, the vast majority of the area only accumulated a light dusting of no more than one-quarter to one-half inch, although much of it fell in a short-but-intense burst as a narrow band swung through from west-to-east, briefly reducing visibility to as low as one-quarter mile. The main concentration of slightly higher snow amounts in the 1-2 range targeted Valley County in the far northern local area, as any truly-significant snow totals remained north-through-northwest of South Central Nebraska. Temperature-wise, the 12th was impressively-cold by mid-April standards, featuring daytime highs of only 31-35 F across most of the area (roughly 30 degrees below normal) and wind chill values only in the teens. In fact, this event ushered in a markedly-cold, six-day stretch centered from April 12th-17th. At Hastings airport, the average daily temperature over these six days of 34.4 F (16 degrees below normal) established a record for the overall-coldest six-day stretch so late in the spring.||Finishing up with the meteorological background behind this unpleasant Easter, the main player in the mid-upper levels was a large-scale trough traversing the central CONUS, highlighted by broad low pressure and various embedded disturbances extending southward from southern Canada, and also a potent southern stream shortwave trough ejecting east-northeast across Texas. Given that South Central Nebraska resided just south of the main northern stream disturbance, mid-level saturation ended up lacking somewhat, thus promoting more drizzle than snow overall. At the surface, a powerful cold front blasted through the local area during the pre-dawn hours of the 12th, turning the pleasant temperatures in the 70s F on the 11th into a fleeting memory. The intense north winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient between a roughly 997 millibar low tracking east across the Southern Plains and a 1032 millibar high emanating southeastward from the Northern Rockies.",A wind gust of 58 MPH was recorded by a mesonet station located 1 mile north of Nelson.,CSV

Fairly typical summertime weather pattern occurred on this day in which scattered thunderstorms developed over the High Plains during the late afternoon, posing a tornado and large hail threat, then organized into a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) as they shifted eastward through the evening into an increasing moist, and unstable environment. As is often the case with QLCS events in this part of the country during this time of year, severe wind gusts were the primary threat. Thunderstorm mergers over extreme southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas promoted the development of a significant pool of cold air which caused a segment of thunderstorms, within the broader line of thunderstorms, to quickly accelerate eastward into western portions of the County Warning Area (CWA) between 7-8pm CDT. By the time this activity arrived it already had a history of producing widespread 60-70mph wind gusts, and even isolated 70-80+mph wind gusts in the vicinity of Hill City, Kansas. The bowing line of thunderstorms continued to produce a swath of severe winds as it moved through the southern half (or so) of the CWA through the late evening hours. For south central Nebraska, severe reports were confined to areas mainly along and south of Highway 6 in Furnas and Harlan Counties, though a Cooperative Observer in Gosper County estimated up to 70mph wind gusts. Damage to trees and power lines were the main impacts of the severe wind. The strongest thunderstorm cores, on the leading edge of the QLCS, exited the area to the southeast by around midnight. Trailing stratiform rain lingered for a couple more hours.||As mentioned above, the meteorological conditions were quite typical for this area for early July. A warm and moist air mass and steep mid level lapse rates supported very strong instability (MLCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg) across a large portion of the Central Plains. A broad upper level ridge axis was in place from the southern Plains into the Upper Mississippi River Valley, resulting in weak southwesterly flow aloft. Because of the upper ridging, deep layer wind shear was weak at less than 30 knots, with much of the shear owing to veering of wind direction in the low to mid levels. This indicates that primarily mesoscale features such as an MCV and a strong cold pool were the main factors that supported severe wind in this event, and not synoptic scale features. Downdraft CAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg were indicative of the strong potential for cool pool development.",Wind gusts were estimated to be near 70 MPH.

Thunderstorm mergers over extreme southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas promoted the development of a significant pool of cold air which caused a segment of thunderstorms, within the broader line of thunderstorms, to quickly accelerate eastward into western portions of the County Warning Area (CWA) between 7-8pm CDT. By the time this activity arrived it already had a history of producing widespread 60-70mph wind gusts, and even isolated 70-80+mph wind gusts in the vicinity of Hill City, Kansas. The bowing line of thunderstorms continued to produce a swath of severe winds as it moved through the southern half (or so) of the CWA through the late evening hours. For north central Kansas, severe wind reports were most concentrated across areas south of Highway 36 and west of Highway 281. The strongest reported gust was 70mph in Plainville, Kansas. Damage to trees and power lines were the main impacts of the severe wind. The strongest thunderstorm cores, on the leading edge of the QLCS, exited the area to the southeast by around midnight. Trailing stratiform rain lingered for a couple more hours.||As mentioned above, the meteorological conditions were quite typical for this area for early July. A warm and moist air mass and steep mid level lapse rates supported very strong instability (MLCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg) across a large portion of the Central Plains. A broad upper level ridge axis was in place from the southern Plains into the Upper Mississippi River Valley, resulting in weak southwesterly flow aloft. Because of the upper ridging, deep layer wind shear was weak at less than 30 knots, with much of the shear owing to veering of wind direction in the low to mid levels. This indicates that primarily mesoscale features such as an MCV and a strong cold pool were the main factors that supported severe wind in this event, and not synoptic scale features. Downdraft CAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg were indicative of the strong potential for cool pool development.",A tree was blown down on 30 Road between E and F Roads.,CSV

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line and produced several instances of 60-75 mph wind gusts and isolated severe hail north/northwest of the CWA. Thunderstorms increased in organization into a bow echo over Furnas and Gosper Counties in Nebraska, then entered far western/northwestern portions of north central Kansas between 10:30-11pm CDT. By 11pm CDT, the QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred north of the state line, however, several severe wind reports were also reported roughly along and north of Highway 36 between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Peak wind gusts across north central Kansas generally remained 60-65mph. The only known damage was to a roof of a mobile home in Mitchell County, though at least minor tree and crop damage likely occurred across at least portions of the area as well. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. Severe hail associated with this activity remained just north of the state line, over Furnas County, where regenerating thunderstorms were most intense.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset. Finally, it's worth noting that an impressive surface pressure rise/fall couplet of at least 3mb/2hr accompanied the QLCS across the CWA between 05Z and 07Z.",Wind gusts estimated to be near 65 MPH caused roof damage to a mobile home.,CSV

Thunderstorms developed between 3pm and 4pm CDT from southwest to northeast, generally along a line from Rooks County in north central Kansas, to Thayer County in south central Nebraska. Once thunderstorms developed, heavy rain quickly became the main concern, though a few non-severe wind gusts around 50 to 55 mph were reported across north central Kansas early on in the event. The heavy rain threat was driven by several factors, including: weak mid and upper level winds which resulted in slow storm motion, training of thunderstorms over the same areas for several hours, and unusually high atmospheric moisture levels. In fact, precipitable water values were near 2��� on this evening, which is near 3 standard deviations above normal and in the upper 90th percentile of climatology. Heavy rain rates of 1-2��� per hour, or higher, were common under the strongest thunderstorm cores, especially between the hours of 4pm and 9pm CDT. Thunderstorms gradually decreased in intensity during the late evening as the persistent convection over the same areas and loss of daytime heating led to decreasing instability. The majority of the lingering light rain ended by midnight.||Heavy rain occurred across most of north central Kansas, with the exception of northern Phillips County and northern Smith County.

Low to mid level warm air advection ahead of a lead shortwave trough led to the development of scattered showers and thunderstorms roughly along a line from Hastings to Superior between 6-8am CDT. Locally heavy rain rates and slow moving thunderstorms led to areas of heavy rain across portions of Clay, Nuckolls, Fillmore and Thayer Counties during the mid to late morning hours. Soil conditions in these areas were already saturated due to previous heavy rain events over the recent days. Activity decreased in coverage and intensity around midday, and most areas were dry by 1pm CDT. Total rain amounts of 2-3 inches were common across these areas, which led to renewed flooding, particularly over Thayer County. The primary impact was water covering county roads and water flowing over Highway 136 west of Deshler.

For the first round, thunderstorms initially formed near the South Dakota and Nebraska border during the early afternoon hours, then shifted southeast into central Nebraska and eventually the northwest portions of the GID CWA during the late afternoon and early evening. Most of the severe reports were associated with an intense supercell on the southwestern flank of a line of thunderstorms. This supercell tracked from just south of Valentine to Broken Bow before it entered the local area in Buffalo and Sherman Counties around 5:30PM CDT. Multiple reports of 50-60mph wind gusts were received, along with 5 ft tall corn being blown over in northern Buffalo County. This thunderstorm continued southeast and impacted Kearney with 60-70mph winds, including a 61mph gust at the Kearney Airport. Additional severe wind reports, and even some quarter to half dollar size hail, occurred in Kearney County before the system weakened as it neared the state line during the late evening. These thunderstorms were supported by MLCAPE values of 2000-3000 J/kg, steep mid level lapse rates, and very strong effective shear of 50-60kt. ||The next round of thunderstorms brought high winds to central and northern portions of the area between 11PM CDT on the 10th, and 1AM CDT on the 11th. This round of severe weather actually stemmed from thunderstorms that developed well northwest of the area, across southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, during the afternoon hours of July 10th. Weakening had been noted around midnight as the leading edge shifted into the northwest CWA, likely impacted by the remnant cool, drier outflow from the first wave resulting in decreasing surface based instability and increasing inhibition. However, a mesohigh quickly developed over north central Nebraska, which resulted in a rapidly increasing low level pressure gradient force and strong pressure rises. In fact, pressure rises on the order of 8-9mb/2 hr were noted at both Ord and Grand Island ASOSs.

For the first round, thunderstorms initially formed near the South Dakota and Nebraska border during the early afternoon hours, then shifted southeast into central Nebraska and eventually the northwest portions of the GID CWA during the late afternoon and early evening. Most of the severe reports were associated with an intense supercell on the southwestern flank of a line of thunderstorms. This supercell tracked from just south of Valentine to Broken Bow before it entered the local area in Buffalo and Sherman Counties around 5:30PM CDT. Multiple reports of 50-60mph wind gusts were received, along with 5 ft tall corn being blown over in northern Buffalo County. This thunderstorm continued southeast and impacted Kearney with 60-70mph winds, including a 61mph gust at the Kearney Airport. Additional severe wind reports, and even some quarter to half dollar size hail, occurred in Kearney County before the system weakened as it neared the state line during the late evening. These thunderstorms were supported by MLCAPE values of 2000-3000 J/kg, steep mid level lapse rates, and very strong effective shear of 50-60kt. ||The next round of thunderstorms brought high winds to central and northern portions of the area between 11PM CDT on the 10th, and 1AM CDT on the 11th. This round of severe weather actually stemmed from thunderstorms that developed well northwest of the area, across southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, during the afternoon hours of July 10th. Weakening had been noted around midnight as the leading edge shifted into the northwest CWA, likely impacted by the remnant cool, drier outflow from the first wave resulting in decreasing surface based instability and increasing inhibition. However, a mesohigh quickly developed over north central Nebraska, which resulted in a rapidly increasing low level pressure gradient force and strong pressure rises. In fact, pressure rises on the order of 8-9mb/2 hr were noted at both Ord and Grand Island ASOSs. The pressure rises allowed strong wind to develop, despite an overall weakening trend within the convection itself. Multiple reports of 55-65mph wind gusts occurred with this second round of activity, impacting areas from Ord to Hastings, including Grand Island, east to the York area. The strong winds resulted in numerous downed tree branches and power lines. The pressure gradient and wind gusts gradually relaxed after 1AM, and any additional gusts remained sub severe.||The next round of thunderstorms brought high winds to central and northern portions of the area between 11PM CDT on the 10th, and 1AM CDT on the 11th.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line and produced several instances of 60-75 mph wind gusts and isolated severe hail north/northwest of the CWA. Thunderstorms increased in organization into a bow echo over Furnas and Gosper Counties in Nebraska, then entered far western/northwestern portions of north central Kansas between 10:30-11pm CDT. By 11pm CDT, the QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred north of the state line, however, several severe wind reports were also reported roughly along and north of Highway 36 between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Peak wind gusts across north central Kansas generally remained 60-65mph. The only known damage was to a roof of a mobile home in Mitchell County, though at least minor tree and crop damage likely occurred across at least portions of the area as well. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. Severe hail associated with this activity remained just north of the state line, over Furnas County, where regenerating thunderstorms were most intense.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles.

Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset. Finally, it's worth noting that an impressive surface pressure rise/fall couplet of at least 3mb/2hr accompanied the QLCS across the CWA between 05Z and 07Z.",A wind gust of 64 MPH was recorded by a mesonet station located 3 miles west-northwest of Alda.,CSV

Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas.

The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well.

Strong southerly wind gusts from the previous day (see November 8th Storm Data entry) continued into the early morning hours of November 9th, which allowed for copious amounts of atmospheric moisture to advect into the region ahead of a cold front. The cold front moved through the area from northwest to southeast during the morning and afternoon hours, with little in the way of precipitation. The front slowed down by late afternoon as surface low pressure organized over the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and the cold front eventually stalled out from central Kansas to central Iowa, just southeast of the NWS Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). This resulted in a sharp temperature gradient at the surface across the area, with cold air in the 20s across northwest portions of the CWA, 30s to low 40s across the far southeast CWA, and the surface freezing line from north central Kansas to east central Nebraska. Later during the evening hours, showers and even weak thunderstorms blossomed as moisture and weak instability interacted with the stalled cold front and shallow low level cold air mass. This set the stage for a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain across south central Nebraska during the evening hours of November 9th. Rain rates were impressive by November standards, and with surface temperatures below freezing, ice accretion began quickly. The greatest ice accretion occurred from around 8pm on the 9th until 2am on the 10th before mid level dry air was advected in from the southwest. The system was not done causing wintry weather across the area, however, as the surface and upper level low pressure ejected northeast from the southern High Plains into the Lower MO Valley and wrap around moisture brought a period of light to moderate snow during the morning hours of the 10, mainly after 4am. Several inches of snow fell across areas mainly north of Interstate 80, with the highest amounts of 4 to 6 inches observed in Greeley County. Only lingering light snow and flurries continued into the afternoon hours of the 10th.||Impacts from the ice were widespread from Webster and Nuckolls Counties northeast to Nance and Polk Counties, particularly in terms of tree damage, where ice accretion of at least one quarter of an inch was observed. Within the broader zone of ice damage, a smaller swath around 30-40 miles wide of more severe impacts appears to have occurred from Adams and Clay Counties northeast to portions of York and Polk Counties. This is where large tree limbs (10 to 15 inches in diameter) were snapped and where power outages were most common and long-lasting, some in excess of 24 hours (mainly rural areas). Also, some of the large tree limbs fell onto roadways and further complicated already hazardous travel conditions. A Cooperative Observer just northeast of Shelby, NE (in Polk County) reported ice accumulation as high as one half inch. School and business closures were numerous not only in the areas affected by ice, but also further north where snow was more prevalent. Meteorologically speaking, this event was impressive due to very high amounts of moisture, and even some instability, that overlapped with near or below freezing temperatures at the surface. Precipitable water values (PWATs) were as high as 1.0 to 1.2 inches, again, anomalously high for November. While this event was certainly towards the higher end of recent ice events, the area was fortunate it wasn���t worse for several reasons: 1) Rain rates, while impressive, were actually too high for optimal and efficient ice accretion 2) surface temperatures were generally one to two degrees too warm for optimal ice accretion 3) Surface winds were relatively light and 4) duration of ice accretion was limited to around 6 hrs. We can say with relatively high confidence that if even one of the above factors was worse, this event could���ve been much more severe.

Strong southerly wind gusts from the previous day (see November 8th Storm Data entry) continued into the early morning hours of November 9th, which allowed for copious amounts of atmospheric moisture to advect into the region ahead of a cold front. The cold front moved through the area from northwest to southeast during the morning and afternoon hours, with little in the way of precipitation. The front slowed down by late afternoon as surface low pressure organized over the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and the cold front eventually stalled out from central Kansas to central Iowa, just southeast of the NWS Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). This resulted in a sharp temperature gradient at the surface across the area, with cold air in the 20s across northwest portions of the CWA, 30s to low 40s across the far southeast CWA, and the surface freezing line from north central Kansas to east central Nebraska. Later during the evening hours, showers and even weak thunderstorms blossomed as moisture and weak instability interacted with the stalled cold front and shallow low level cold air mass. This set the stage for a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain across south central Nebraska during the evening hours of November 9th. Rain rates were impressive by November standards, and with surface temperatures below freezing, ice accretion began quickly. The greatest ice accretion occurred from around 8pm on the 9th until 2am on the 10th before mid level dry air was advected in from the southwest. The system was not done causing wintry weather across the area, however, as the surface and upper level low pressure ejected northeast from the southern High Plains into the Lower MO Valley and wrap around moisture brought a period of light to moderate snow during the morning hours of the 10, mainly after 4am. Several inches of snow fell across areas mainly north of Interstate 80, with the highest amounts of 4 to 6 inches observed in Greeley County. Only lingering light snow and flurries continued into the afternoon hours of the 10th.||Impacts from the ice were widespread from Webster and Nuckolls Counties northeast to Nance and Polk Counties, particularly in terms of tree damage, where ice accretion of at least one quarter of an inch was observed. Within the broader zone of ice damage, a smaller swath around 30-40 miles wide of more severe impacts appears to have occurred from Adams and Clay Counties northeast to portions of York and Polk Counties. This is where large tree limbs (10 to 15 inches in diameter) were snapped and where power outages were most common and long-lasting, some in excess of 24 hours (mainly rural areas). Also, some of the large tree limbs fell onto roadways and further complicated already hazardous travel conditions. A Cooperative Observer just northeast of Shelby, NE (in Polk County) reported ice accumulation as high as one half inch. School and business closures were numerous not only in the areas affected by ice, but also further north where snow was more prevalent. Meteorologically speaking, this event was impressive due to very high amounts of moisture, and even some instability, that overlapped with near or below freezing temperatures at the surface. Precipitable water values (PWATs) were as high as 1.0 to 1.2 inches, again, anomalously high for November. While this event was certainly towards the higher end of recent ice events, the area was fortunate it wasn���t worse for several reasons: 1) Rain rates, while impressive, were actually too high for optimal and efficient ice accretion 2) surface temperatures were generally one to two degrees too warm for optimal ice accretion 3) Surface winds were relatively light and 4) duration of ice accretion was limited to around 6 hrs.

Strong southerly wind gusts from the previous day (see November 8th Storm Data entry) continued into the early morning hours of November 9th, which allowed for copious amounts of atmospheric moisture to advect into the region ahead of a cold front. The cold front moved through the area from northwest to southeast during the morning and afternoon hours, with little in the way of precipitation. The front slowed down by late afternoon as surface low pressure organized over the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and the cold front eventually stalled out from central Kansas to central Iowa, just southeast of the NWS Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). This resulted in a sharp temperature gradient at the surface across the area, with cold air in the 20s across northwest portions of the CWA, 30s to low 40s across the far southeast CWA, and the surface freezing line from north central Kansas to east central Nebraska. Later during the evening hours, showers and even weak thunderstorms blossomed as moisture and weak instability interacted with the stalled cold front and shallow low level cold air mass. This set the stage for a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain across south central Nebraska during the evening hours of November 9th. Rain rates were impressive by November standards, and with surface temperatures below freezing, ice accretion began quickly. The greatest ice accretion occurred from around 8pm on the 9th until 2am on the 10th before mid level dry air was advected in from the southwest. The system was not done causing wintry weather across the area, however, as the surface and upper level low pressure ejected northeast from the southern High Plains into the Lower MO Valley and wrap around moisture brought a period of light to moderate snow during the morning hours of the 10, mainly after 4am. Several inches of snow fell across areas mainly north of Interstate 80, with the highest amounts of 4 to 6 inches observed in Greeley County. Only lingering light snow and flurries continued into the afternoon hours of the 10th.||Impacts from the ice were widespread from Webster and Nuckolls Counties northeast to Nance and Polk Counties, particularly in terms of tree damage, where ice accretion of at least one quarter of an inch was observed. Within the broader zone of ice damage, a smaller swath around 30-40 miles wide of more severe impacts appears to have occurred from Adams and Clay Counties northeast to portions of York and Polk Counties. This is where large tree limbs (10 to 15 inches in diameter) were snapped and where power outages were most common and long-lasting, some in excess of 24 hours (mainly rural areas). Also, some of the large tree limbs fell onto roadways and further complicated already hazardous travel conditions. A Cooperative Observer just northeast of Shelby, NE (in Polk County) reported ice accumulation as high as one half inch. School and business closures were numerous not only in the areas affected by ice, but also further north where snow was more prevalent. Meteorologically speaking, this event was impressive due to very high amounts of moisture, and even some instability, that overlapped with near or below freezing temperatures at the surface. Precipitable water values (PWATs) were as high as 1.0 to 1.2 inches, again, anomalously high for November. While this event was certainly towards the higher end of recent ice events, the area was fortunate it wasn���t worse for several reasons: 1) Rain rates, while impressive, were actually too high for optimal and efficient ice accretion 2) surface temperatures were generally one to two degrees too warm for optimal ice accretion 3) Surface winds were relatively light and 4) duration of ice accretion was limited to around 6 hrs. We can say with relatively high confidence that if even one of the above factors was worse, this event could���ve been much more severe. Finally, it's worth noting that for many, this was the most significant precipitation event in around two months, as many areas along and east of Highway 281 received 0.75��� to 1��� or more of moisture.","Freezing rain and freezing drizzle resulted in a coating of ice at least one-quarter inch thick. Travel was hazardous, and numerous tree limbs were downed. Power lines were also affected, causing power outages.",CSV

Strong southerly wind gusts from the previous day (see November 8th Storm Data entry) continued into the early morning hours of November 9th, which allowed for copious amounts of atmospheric moisture to advect into the region ahead of a cold front. The cold front moved through the area from northwest to southeast during the morning and afternoon hours, with little in the way of precipitation. The front slowed down by late afternoon as surface low pressure organized over the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and the cold front eventually stalled out from central Kansas to central Iowa, just southeast of the NWS Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). This resulted in a sharp temperature gradient at the surface across the area, with cold air in the 20s across northwest portions of the CWA, 30s to low 40s across the far southeast CWA, and the surface freezing line from north central Kansas to east central Nebraska. Later during the evening hours, showers and even weak thunderstorms blossomed as moisture and weak instability interacted with the stalled cold front and shallow low level cold air mass. This set the stage for a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain across south central Nebraska during the evening hours of November 9th. Rain rates were impressive by November standards, and with surface temperatures below freezing, ice accretion began quickly. The greatest ice accretion occurred from around 8pm on the 9th until 2am on the 10th before mid level dry air was advected in from the southwest. The system was not done causing wintry weather across the area, however, as the surface and upper level low pressure ejected northeast from the southern High Plains into the Lower MO Valley and wrap around moisture brought a period of light to moderate snow during the morning hours of the 10, mainly after 4am. Several inches of snow fell across areas mainly north of Interstate 80, with the highest amounts of 4 to 6 inches observed in Greeley County. Only lingering light snow and flurries continued into the afternoon hours of the 10th.||Impacts from the ice were widespread from Webster and Nuckolls Counties northeast to Nance and Polk Counties, particularly in terms of tree damage, where ice accretion of at least one quarter of an inch was observed. Within the broader zone of ice damage, a smaller swath around 30-40 miles wide of more severe impacts appears to have occurred from Adams and Clay Counties northeast to portions of York and Polk Counties. This is where large tree limbs (10 to 15 inches in diameter) were snapped and where power outages were most common and long-lasting, some in excess of 24 hours (mainly rural areas). Also, some of the large tree limbs fell onto roadways and further complicated already hazardous travel conditions. A Cooperative Observer just northeast of Shelby, NE (in Polk County) reported ice accumulation as high as one half inch. School and business closures were numerous not only in the areas affected by ice, but also further north where snow was more prevalent. Meteorologically speaking, this event was impressive due to very high amounts of moisture, and even some instability, that overlapped with near or below freezing temperatures at the surface. Precipitable water values (PWATs) were as high as 1.0 to 1.2 inches, again, anomalously high for November. While this event was certainly towards the higher end of recent ice events, the area was fortunate it wasn���t worse for several reasons: 1) Rain rates, while impressive, were actually too high for optimal and efficient ice accretion 2) surface temperatures were generally one to two degrees too warm for optimal ice accretion 3) Surface winds were relatively light and 4) duration of ice accretion was limited to around 6 hrs. We can say with relatively high confidence that if even one of the above factors was worse, this event could���ve been much more severe.

The front slowed down by late afternoon as surface low pressure organized over the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and the cold front eventually stalled out from central Kansas to central Iowa, just southeast of the NWS Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). This resulted in a sharp temperature gradient at the surface across the area, with cold air in the 20s across northwest portions of the CWA, 30s to low 40s across the far southeast CWA, and the surface freezing line from north central Kansas to east central Nebraska. Later during the evening hours, showers and even weak thunderstorms blossomed as moisture and weak instability interacted with the stalled cold front and shallow low level cold air mass. This set the stage for a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain across south central Nebraska during the evening hours of November 9th. Rain rates were impressive by November standards, and with surface temperatures below freezing, ice accretion began quickly. The greatest ice accretion occurred from around 8pm on the 9th until 2am on the 10th before mid level dry air was advected in from the southwest. The system was not done causing wintry weather across the area, however, as the surface and upper level low pressure ejected northeast from the southern High Plains into the Lower MO Valley and wrap around moisture brought a period of light to moderate snow during the morning hours of the 10, mainly after 4am. Several inches of snow fell across areas mainly north of Interstate 80, with the highest amounts of 4 to 6 inches observed in Greeley County. Only lingering light snow and flurries continued into the afternoon hours of the 10th.||Impacts from the ice were widespread from Webster and Nuckolls Counties northeast to Nance and Polk Counties, particularly in terms of tree damage, where ice accretion of at least one quarter of an inch was observed. Within the broader zone of ice damage, a smaller swath around 30-40 miles wide of more severe impacts appears to have occurred from Adams and Clay Counties northeast to portions of York and Polk Counties. This is where large tree limbs (10 to 15 inches in diameter) were snapped and where power outages were most common and long-lasting, some in excess of 24 hours (mainly rural areas). Also, some of the large tree limbs fell onto roadways and further complicated already hazardous travel conditions. A Cooperative Observer just northeast of Shelby, NE (in Polk County) reported ice accumulation as high as one half inch. School and business closures were numerous not only in the areas affected by ice, but also further north where snow was more prevalent. Meteorologically speaking, this event was impressive due to very high amounts of moisture, and even some instability, that overlapped with near or below freezing temperatures at the surface. Precipitable water values (PWATs) were as high as 1.0 to 1.2 inches, again, anomalously high for November. While this event was certainly towards the higher end of recent ice events, the area was fortunate it wasn���t worse for several reasons: 1) Rain rates, while impressive, were actually too high for optimal and efficient ice accretion 2) surface temperatures were generally one to two degrees too warm for optimal ice accretion 3) Surface winds were relatively light and 4) duration of ice accretion was limited to around 6 hrs. We can say with relatively high confidence that if even one of the above factors was worse, this event could���ve been much more severe. Finally, it's worth noting that for many, this was the most significant precipitation event in around two months, as many areas along and east of Highway 281 received 0.75��� to 1��� or more of moisture.","Freezing rain and freezing drizzle resulted in a coating of ice at least one-quarter inch thick.

Strong southerly wind gusts from the previous day (see November 8th Storm Data entry) continued into the early morning hours of November 9th, which allowed for copious amounts of atmospheric moisture to advect into the region ahead of a cold front. The cold front moved through the area from northwest to southeast during the morning and afternoon hours, with little in the way of precipitation. The front slowed down by late afternoon as surface low pressure organized over the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and the cold front eventually stalled out from central Kansas to central Iowa, just southeast of the NWS Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). This resulted in a sharp temperature gradient at the surface across the area, with cold air in the 20s across northwest portions of the CWA, 30s to low 40s across the far southeast CWA, and the surface freezing line from north central Kansas to east central Nebraska. Later during the evening hours, showers and even weak thunderstorms blossomed as moisture and weak instability interacted with the stalled cold front and shallow low level cold air mass. This set the stage for a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain across south central Nebraska during the evening hours of November 9th. Rain rates were impressive by November standards, and with surface temperatures below freezing, ice accretion began quickly. The greatest ice accretion occurred from around 8pm on the 9th until 2am on the 10th before mid level dry air was advected in from the southwest. The system was not done causing wintry weather across the area, however, as the surface and upper level low pressure ejected northeast from the southern High Plains into the Lower MO Valley and wrap around moisture brought a period of light to moderate snow during the morning hours of the 10, mainly after 4am. Several inches of snow fell across areas mainly north of Interstate 80, with the highest amounts of 4 to 6 inches observed in Greeley County. Only lingering light snow and flurries continued into the afternoon hours of the 10th.||Impacts from the ice were widespread from Webster and Nuckolls Counties northeast to Nance and Polk Counties, particularly in terms of tree damage, where ice accretion of at least one quarter of an inch was observed. Within the broader zone of ice damage, a smaller swath around 30-40 miles wide of more severe impacts appears to have occurred from Adams and Clay Counties northeast to portions of York and Polk Counties. This is where large tree limbs (10 to 15 inches in diameter) were snapped and where power outages were most common and long-lasting, some in excess of 24 hours (mainly rural areas). Also, some of the large tree limbs fell onto roadways and further complicated already hazardous travel conditions. A Cooperative Observer just northeast of Shelby, NE (in Polk County) reported ice accumulation as high as one half inch. School and business closures were numerous not only in the areas affected by ice, but also further north where snow was more prevalent. Meteorologically speaking, this event was impressive due to very high amounts of moisture, and even some instability, that overlapped with near or below freezing temperatures at the surface. Precipitable water values (PWATs) were as high as 1.0 to 1.2 inches, again, anomalously high for November. While this event was certainly towards the higher end of recent ice events, the area was fortunate it wasn���t worse for several reasons: 1) Rain rates, while impressive, were actually too high for optimal and efficient ice accretion 2) surface temperatures were generally one to two degrees too warm for optimal ice accretion 3) Surface winds were relatively light and 4) duration of ice accretion was limited to around 6 hrs. We can say with relatively high confidence that if even one of the above factors was worse, this event could���ve been much more severe. Finally, it's worth noting that for many, this was the most significant precipitation event in around two months, as many areas along and east of Highway 281 received 0.75��� to 1��� or more of moisture.","Freezing rain and freezing drizzle resulted in a coating of ice at least one-quarter inch thick.

As a result, the U.S. Drought Monitor gradually expanded the coverage of D2 Severe Drought over the course of the month. As September opened, D2 drought was already assigned to much of Kearney/Adams counties, and adjacent smaller portions of Buffalo, Hall and Clay counties. On the 8th, D2 expanded slightly to also include small portions of Phelps, Franklin and Webster counties. Finally, one more small expansion of D2 on the 22nd brought northeastern Harlan County into the mix as well, making for a total of nine counties at least partially included in Severe Drought for at least some portion of the month. Outside of the worst-off D2 area, both D1 Moderate Drought and D0 Abnormally Dry also expanded across much of South Central Nebraska during September. Of all 24 local counties, only the majority of Thayer County managed to remain void of all drought categories (including D0) through the month. ||Digging deeper into September rainfall, although the month was not as acutely dry as August, the majority of the area was again below-average, with most places tallying between 30-80 percent of normal. In general, the overall-driest official NWS totals focused within northern/western counties, including 0.57 at Ord airport, 0.66 eight miles south of Elwood and 0.67 at Miller. On the opposite end of the spectrum, parts of Thayer County featured the only legitimate above normal amounts in South Central Nebraska, including as much as 3.45 at Hebron. Over the longer-term four-month period from June-September, some of the driest portions of the area only received 4-6 of rain (generally 35-45 percent of normal). This included only 4.92 at Minden (2nd-driest on record), 4.97 at Kearney airport (5th-driest), 5.58 in St. Paul (4th-driest) and 5.66 at Hastings airport (outright-driest). Fortunately, hot temperatures were not a major factor contributing to drought stress for the majority of September, as most of the area observed monthly departures from near-normal to 2 degrees cooler-than-normal. However, a notable exception was the week of the 20th-26th, during which every day saw highs into at least the 80s (and even a few 90s). Although there were no widespread/major drought impacts noted within South Central Nebraska during September, pastures and dryland crops exhibited continued stress as the growing season drew to a close, and some area rivers/streams reported below normal stream flows (including the Little Blue River).",,CSV

In addition to dropping three fairly brief EF-0 tornadoes in southeastern Hamilton and northeastern Clay counties, its main calling card was large hail, with several reports of golf ball to slightly larger than baseball size stones in Clay/Nuckolls counties, and smaller hail to around quarter size as far north as Osceola. Interestingly, damaging winds were not a major player, with no ground-truth gusts in excess of 50 MPH. Focusing on specific storm reports, and starting with the three EF-0 tornadoes, they all occurred between 5-6 p.m. CDT, touching down briefly along a roughly 15-mile long corridor from near Interstate 80 a few miles south of Hampton, down to the Saronville area. Per storm surveys, the first two tornadoes were each on the ground for roughly 2 miles. While the majority of minor damage was confined to crops and trees, a lean-to shed was destroyed and a pivot overturned. As for the hail, the largest reported was 3 diameter between Clay Center and Harvard, but towns including Sutton and Nelson endured stones to at least tennis ball size. Flooding was not much of an issue, as the storm was progressive enough to keep rainfall amounts largely under one inch. ||Breaking down the meteorological background and event timing, this was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for South Central Nebraska, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C providing a healthy cap. On the other hand, low-level forcing was seasonably-strong, as a well-defined cold front slid southeastward into the area during the afternoon. Ahead of this boundary, a significantly-unstable airmass awaited, featuring temperatures in the upper 80s-low 90s F/dewpoints upper 60s-mid 70s F, yielding formidable mixed-layer CAPE around 4000 J/kg. This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection. As for what actually transpired, the main show was preceded by a broken line of non-severe, likely elevated storms that passed primarily through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 between 12:30-3:30 p.m. CDT. About the time this innocuous early afternoon activity was departing the local area to the southeast, a broken line of true, surface-based storms got going along the front in northeast Nebraska, with the southwestern-most cell building down into the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska (eastern Nance/northeast Merrick/northern Polk counties) between 3-4 p.m. CDT. Within an hour thereafter, this tail end Charlie storm rapidly grew into a full-blown supercell over Polk/northern York counties, producing its first marginally-severe hail reports. During the following two hours (5-7 p.m. CDT), the storm anchored itself firmly to the surface front, with new updraft generation along its western edge promoting more of a southwestward propagation and causing it to grow larger in both intensity/size, becoming more of a supercell cluster. It was during this time that the brief tornadoes occurred along the storm's far western flank, likely driven by pronounced low-level vorticity stretching along the surface front. While the sporadic tornado touchdowns were brief, the storm continued to be a prolific hail-producer as it gradually exited the local area out of Nuckolls County into northern Kansas between 7-8 p.m. CDT, ending all South Central Nebraska convection for the night.",,CSV

In the Tri Cities, only Grand Island saw severe weather, as two rounds of quarter to half dollar size hail moved through, one mainly affecting the north side of town (including the airport) around 6 p.m. CDT, and another about an hour later that clipped more of the city. As for thunderstorm winds, the vast majority of gusts captured by area sensors were non-severe (generally 40-50 MPH), but there were two reports estimated around 60 MPH, one near Hampton and another at Hebron, where a few large trees were downed and a store front sustained minor damage. Given fairly progressive storm motions, rainfall totals in most affected areas were less than 1 inch during the afternoon/evening. However, combined with localized heavy rain that fell during a separate round of early morning/non-severe activity, portions of mainly eastern Clay County registered over 3 for the day (including NWS coop observer total of 3.33 six miles east-southeast of Clay Center).

While most hail was in the quarter to golf ball size range, larger stones of 2-3 diameter fell in the Chapman and Marquette areas of Merrick/Hamilton counties. Ping pong to golf ball size hail occurred in or near the following communities/locations: Fullerton, Amherst, Orleans, Harlan County Lake, Naponee and Deweese. In the Tri Cities, only Grand Island saw severe weather, as two rounds of quarter to half dollar size hail moved through, one mainly affecting the north side of town (including the airport) around 6 p.m. CDT, and another about an hour later that clipped more of the city. As for thunderstorm winds, the vast majority of gusts captured by area sensors were non-severe (generally 40-50 MPH), but there were two reports estimated around 60 MPH, one near Hampton and another at Hebron, where a few large trees were downed and a store front sustained minor damage. Given fairly progressive storm motions, rainfall totals in most affected areas were less than 1 inch during the afternoon/evening. However, combined with localized heavy rain that fell during a separate round of early morning/non-severe activity, portions of mainly eastern Clay County registered over 3 for the day (including NWS coop observer total of 3.33 six miles east-southeast of Clay Center). As a result, the later-day storms prompted some isolated flash flooding, as School Creek overtopped the paved spur road south of Saronville. ||This event was characterized by truly scattered, hit-or-miss convection, as afternoon heating and subtle convergence along/ahead of a weak cold front sagging southward into the region prompted several strong to severe storms, mainly in the form of multicells/multicell clusters, but also a few brief supercells. Nearly every county in the 24-county area observed at least a touch of thunderstorm activity. That being said, the majority of ground-truth reports concentrated in two primary areas: 1) parts of Hall/Hamilton/Merrick counties...2) a swath from eastern Furnas to far southwestern Franklin counties. A few of the first severe storms of the event flared up over Furnas/Buffalo counties between 430-530 p.m. CDT, and the final severe storm of the evening was centered over the Nuckolls County area before weakening around 9 p.m. CDT. Thereafter, a smattering of strong storms lingered within counties south of Interstate 80 through around 10:30 pm. CDT before all convection ended for the night. In total, 19 Severe Thunderstorm Warnings were issued within South Central Nebraska over the course of over four hours. Digging deeper into the meteorological setup, it's worth noting that this event exceeded forecast expectations, especially in terms of the number of severe storms. This was due in part to greater-than-expected convective instability, as afternoon surface dewpoints soared into the upper 60s-low 70 F,  promoting significant mixed-layer CAPE of at least 3000-4000 J/kg. In tandem with deep layer wind shear around 35 knots, this CAPE/shear combo proved plenty sufficient for robust convection. In the mid-upper levels, a pronounced north-northwest flow regime resided over the Central Plains, within the interface between a stout western United States ridge and a broad eastern trough.",,CSV

Although radar data suggested that spotty hail to at least nickel size likely occurred within various counties, ground-truth verification was quite limited, consisting of only a few reports of penny to quarter size stones in Hastings around 1:30 a.m. CDT, followed a short time later by the only severe-criteria report of the event: golf ball size hail at Inland in western Clay County. A few hours later (around 4 a.m. CDT), the final strong local storms of the morning dissipated over eastern Fillmore/Thayer counties. There were no reports of strong/severe wind gusts. ||This somewhat-unexpected nocturnal convection (at least in terms of intensity) initiated in the local area over Dawson County shortly before midnight CDT, roughly 50 miles east of a small cluster of strong storms already ongoing off to the west, and roughly 75-100 miles north of the centroid of a small mesoscale convective system (MCS) sliding across northern Kansas (in fact the local storms appeared to be a northward-displaced offshoot of the Kansas MCS). Whether or not the local convection was directly tied to the activity farther south, mesoscale analysis revealed that it was likely sparked by a subtle ribbon of low-mid level warm air/moisture advection within a weak southwesterly low level jet axis (winds at 850 millibars less than 25 knots). Convective parameters were at least marginally-supportive of sporadic intense updrafts, featuring around 1500 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and up to around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

Of the counties impacted by this supercell, Jewell was hardest-hit, as copious amounts of tennis ball to softball size hail stones crashed down onto areas in and near the communities of Mankato and Jewell, causing extensive damage to homes, vehicles and area crops. The hail size toned down somewhat farther south into Mitchell and Osborne counties, where limited reports included ping pong ball size stones in Cawker City and golf ball size south of Osborne. Although damaging winds were not a major player during this event, several mesonets clocked gusts of at least 40-50 MPH, and a Kansas Mesonet site near Jewell reached severe-criteria with 65 MPH. Flooding was not much of an issue, with convection staying progressive enough to keep rainfall amounts largely under one inch.||Breaking down event timing and meteorological background, this giant storm invaded northern Jewell County between 7-8 pm. CDT, having already propagated south-southwestward for roughly 90 miles since its inception in east central Nebraska about three hours prior. As it drifted southward into Mitchell County between 8-9 p.m. CDT it started merging with a much smaller, separate storm that had flared up over central Osborne County. Finally, between 9-10 p.m. CDT, the now-merged supercell cluster continued southward while exiting the local area into central Kansas, ending all local storms for the night. This was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for North Central Kansas, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C promoting a healthy cap.

This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection. As for what actually transpired, the main show was preceded by a broken line of non-severe, likely elevated storms that passed primarily through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 between 12:30-3:30 p.m. CDT. About the time this innocuous early afternoon activity was departing the local area to the southeast, a broken line of true, surface-based storms got going along the front in northeast Nebraska, with the southwestern-most cell building down into the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska (eastern Nance/northeast Merrick/northern Polk counties) between 3-4 p.m. CDT. Within an hour thereafter, this tail end Charlie storm rapidly grew into a full-blown supercell over Polk/northern York counties, producing its first marginally-severe hail reports. During the following two hours (5-7 p.m. CDT), the storm anchored itself firmly to the surface front, with new updraft generation along its western edge promoting more of a southwestward propagation and causing it to grow larger in both intensity/size, becoming more of a supercell cluster. It was during this time that the brief tornadoes occurred along the storm's far western flank, likely driven by pronounced low-level vorticity stretching along the surface front. While the sporadic tornado touchdowns were brief, the storm continued to be a prolific hail-producer as it gradually exited the local area out of Nuckolls County into northern Kansas between 7-8 p.m. CDT, ending all South Central Nebraska convection for the night.",Hail ranging in size from golf balls to baseballs was reported along this path. A vehicle's windshield was cracked approximately 6 miles southeast of Clay Center.,CSV

Ping pong to golf ball size hail occurred in or near the following communities/locations: Fullerton, Amherst, Orleans, Harlan County Lake, Naponee and Deweese. In the Tri Cities, only Grand Island saw severe weather, as two rounds of quarter to half dollar size hail moved through, one mainly affecting the north side of town (including the airport) around 6 p.m. CDT, and another about an hour later that clipped more of the city.

Given fairly progressive storm motions, rainfall totals in most affected areas were less than 1 inch during the afternoon/evening. However, combined with localized heavy rain that fell during a separate round of early morning/non-severe activity, portions of mainly eastern Clay County registered over 3 for the day (including NWS coop observer total of 3.33 six miles east-southeast of Clay Center).

While most hail was in the quarter to golf ball size range, larger stones of 2-3 diameter fell in the Chapman and Marquette areas of Merrick/Hamilton counties. Ping pong to golf ball size hail occurred in or near the following communities/locations: Fullerton, Amherst, Orleans, Harlan County Lake, Naponee and Deweese. In the Tri Cities, only Grand Island saw severe weather, as two rounds of quarter to half dollar size hail moved through, one mainly affecting the north side of town (including the airport) around 6 p.m. CDT, and another about an hour later that clipped more of the city. As for thunderstorm winds, the vast majority of gusts captured by area sensors were non-severe (generally 40-50 MPH), but there were two reports estimated around 60 MPH, one near Hampton and another at Hebron, where a few large trees were downed and a store front sustained minor damage. Given fairly progressive storm motions, rainfall totals in most affected areas were less than 1 inch during the afternoon/evening. However, combined with localized heavy rain that fell during a separate round of early morning/non-severe activity, portions of mainly eastern Clay County registered over 3 for the day (including NWS coop observer total of 3.33 six miles east-southeast of Clay Center). As a result, the later-day storms prompted some isolated flash flooding, as School Creek overtopped the paved spur road south of Saronville. ||This event was characterized by truly scattered, hit-or-miss convection, as afternoon heating and subtle convergence along/ahead of a weak cold front sagging southward into the region prompted several strong to severe storms, mainly in the form of multicells/multicell clusters, but also a few brief supercells.

That being said, the majority of ground-truth reports concentrated in two primary areas: 1) parts of Hall/Hamilton/Merrick counties...2) a swath from eastern Furnas to far southwestern Franklin counties. A few of the first severe storms of the event flared up over Furnas/Buffalo counties between 430-530 p.m. CDT, and the final severe storm of the evening was centered over the Nuckolls County area before weakening around 9 p.m. CDT.

Early in the event (12-1230 a.m. CDT), a few hail reports flirted with severe criteria, including nickel size stones in North Loup and dime size in Ord. All known wind gusts from area sensors registered under 50 MPH. ||Breaking down event timing, it's worth noting that north-northwest local counties had already dodged a possible severe storm threat earlier in the evening, as a broken line of strong to severe storms approaching from central/north central Nebraska fizzled out shortly before reaching the Valley County area around nightfall. A few hours later and shortly before midnight CDT, a few briefly-isolated strong storms rapidly flared up over Valley/Greeley counties, with the western one dropping the aforementioned dime-nickel size hail. Already by 1230 a.m. CDT these cells had merged into a small cluster, and although radar signatures suggested possible severe hail and/or wind across southern Greeley/far northern Howard counties, there were no verifying reports. All convection departed South Central Nebraska out of Polk/York counties between 3-4 a.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, this overnight event was fairly strongly-forced, as the southern edge of a potent shortwave trough swept through the Dakotas and far northern Nebraska. At the surface, storms initiated near/along an associated strong surface cold front sweeping through South Central Nebraska, its nocturnal passage marked by 25-40 MPH northerly gusts. Around the time of the hail in Valley County, the mesoscale environment featured at least 1500 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

This storm entered the county from the west around 9 p.m. CDT as part of a north-south oriented, broken line of convection that initiated hours earlier in northeast Colorado. As the storm tracked along Highway 6/34, a county deputy estimated 60 MPH gusts near Holbrook. Shortly thereafter the storm weakened, and had all but dissipated before reaching Phelps County around 10 p.m. CDT. About an hour later, a completely separate storm (part of a complex that had been drifting across northwestern Nebraska for several hours) entered Valley County from the west-northwest. Although radar briefly suggested it might have reached severe levels, the only known report consisted of pea size hail near Elyria. Like the other storm, this one also weakened considerably within an hour of entering the local area, and there was no additional strong convection  within South Central Nebraska the remainder of the night. In the mid-upper levels, this was a typical summer setup for scattered, loosely-organized convection to survive eastward into the local area off the High Plains during the evening, as weak/low-amplitude disturbances meandered through the prevailing quasi-zonal flow. Post-sunset mesoscale parameters over South Central Nebraska were only marginally-supportive of strong to severe storms, featuring around 1500 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE but no more than 25-30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",Officer reported wind gusts of 60 to 70 MPH while driving between Cambridge and Arapahoe.,CSV

In addition to dropping three fairly brief EF-0 tornadoes in southeastern Hamilton and northeastern Clay counties, its main calling card was large hail, with several reports of golf ball to slightly larger than baseball size stones in Clay/Nuckolls counties, and smaller hail to around quarter size as far north as Osceola. Interestingly, damaging winds were not a major player, with no ground-truth gusts in excess of 50 MPH. Focusing on specific storm reports, and starting with the three EF-0 tornadoes, they all occurred between 5-6 p.m. CDT, touching down briefly along a roughly 15-mile long corridor from near Interstate 80 a few miles south of Hampton, down to the Saronville area. Per storm surveys, the first two tornadoes were each on the ground for roughly 2 miles. While the majority of minor damage was confined to crops and trees, a lean-to shed was destroyed and a pivot overturned. As for the hail, the largest reported was 3 diameter between Clay Center and Harvard, but towns including Sutton and Nelson endured stones to at least tennis ball size. Flooding was not much of an issue, as the storm was progressive enough to keep rainfall amounts largely under one inch. ||Breaking down the meteorological background and event timing, this was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for South Central Nebraska, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C providing a healthy cap. On the other hand, low-level forcing was seasonably-strong, as a well-defined cold front slid southeastward into the area during the afternoon. Ahead of this boundary, a significantly-unstable airmass awaited, featuring temperatures in the upper 80s-low 90s F/dewpoints upper 60s-mid 70s F, yielding formidable mixed-layer CAPE around 4000 J/kg. This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection. As for what actually transpired, the main show was preceded by a broken line of non-severe, likely elevated storms that passed primarily through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 between 12:30-3:30 p.m. CDT. About the time this innocuous early afternoon activity was departing the local area to the southeast, a broken line of true, surface-based storms got going along the front in northeast Nebraska, with the southwestern-most cell building down into the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska (eastern Nance/northeast Merrick/northern Polk counties) between 3-4 p.m. CDT. Within an hour thereafter, this tail end Charlie storm rapidly grew into a full-blown supercell over Polk/northern York counties, producing its first marginally-severe hail reports. During the following two hours (5-7 p.m. CDT), the storm anchored itself firmly to the surface front, with new updraft generation along its western edge promoting more of a southwestward propagation and causing it to grow larger in both intensity/size, becoming more of a supercell cluster. It was during this time that the brief tornadoes occurred along the storm's far western flank, likely driven by pronounced low-level vorticity stretching along the surface front. While the sporadic tornado touchdowns were brief, the storm continued to be a prolific hail-producer as it gradually exited the local area out of Nuckolls County into northern Kansas between 7-8 p.m. CDT, ending all South Central Nebraska convection for the night.",,CSV

During the next hour the storm tracked south-southeast through rural portions of the county as hail size increased to 1.5 diameter, with one resident reporting destroyed rose blooms. Around 9:30 p.m. CDT the now-weakening cell exited the county (and this North Central Kansas area altogether). Although additional, more widespread convection developed into the area a few hours later, these later-night storms were not severe. This sunset severe storm fired up slightly behind a surface cold front slipping southward through the region, as weak low level convergence was able to locally overcome fairly strong capping (as evidenced by 700 millibar temperature around 12C). Despite the passing front, surface dewpoints still held up in the upper 60s F near the storm, promoting decent instability as the evening mesoscale environment featured 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 35 knots of deep-layer wind shear.

In addition to dropping three fairly brief EF-0 tornadoes in southeastern Hamilton and northeastern Clay counties, its main calling card was large hail, with several reports of golf ball to slightly larger than baseball size stones in Clay/Nuckolls counties, and smaller hail to around quarter size as far north as Osceola. Interestingly, damaging winds were not a major player, with no ground-truth gusts in excess of 50 MPH. Focusing on specific storm reports, and starting with the three EF-0 tornadoes, they all occurred between 5-6 p.m. CDT, touching down briefly along a roughly 15-mile long corridor from near Interstate 80 a few miles south of Hampton, down to the Saronville area. Per storm surveys, the first two tornadoes were each on the ground for roughly 2 miles. While the majority of minor damage was confined to crops and trees, a lean-to shed was destroyed and a pivot overturned. As for the hail, the largest reported was 3 diameter between Clay Center and Harvard, but towns including Sutton and Nelson endured stones to at least tennis ball size. Flooding was not much of an issue, as the storm was progressive enough to keep rainfall amounts largely under one inch. ||Breaking down the meteorological background and event timing, this was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for South Central Nebraska, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C providing a healthy cap. On the other hand, low-level forcing was seasonably-strong, as a well-defined cold front slid southeastward into the area during the afternoon. Ahead of this boundary, a significantly-unstable airmass awaited, featuring temperatures in the upper 80s-low 90s F/dewpoints upper 60s-mid 70s F, yielding formidable mixed-layer CAPE around 4000 J/kg. This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection. As for what actually transpired, the main show was preceded by a broken line of non-severe, likely elevated storms that passed primarily through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 between 12:30-3:30 p.m. CDT. About the time this innocuous early afternoon activity was departing the local area to the southeast, a broken line of true, surface-based storms got going along the front in northeast Nebraska, with the southwestern-most cell building down into the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska (eastern Nance/northeast Merrick/northern Polk counties) between 3-4 p.m. CDT. Within an hour thereafter, this tail end Charlie storm rapidly grew into a full-blown supercell over Polk/northern York counties, producing its first marginally-severe hail reports. During the following two hours (5-7 p.m. CDT), the storm anchored itself firmly to the surface front, with new updraft generation along its western edge promoting more of a southwestward propagation and causing it to grow larger in both intensity/size, becoming more of a supercell cluster. It was during this time that the brief tornadoes occurred along the storm's far western flank, likely driven by pronounced low-level vorticity stretching along the surface front.

In addition to dropping three fairly brief EF-0 tornadoes in southeastern Hamilton and northeastern Clay counties, its main calling card was large hail, with several reports of golf ball to slightly larger than baseball size stones in Clay/Nuckolls counties, and smaller hail to around quarter size as far north as Osceola. Interestingly, damaging winds were not a major player, with no ground-truth gusts in excess of 50 MPH. Focusing on specific storm reports, and starting with the three EF-0 tornadoes, they all occurred between 5-6 p.m. CDT, touching down briefly along a roughly 15-mile long corridor from near Interstate 80 a few miles south of Hampton, down to the Saronville area. Per storm surveys, the first two tornadoes were each on the ground for roughly 2 miles. While the majority of minor damage was confined to crops and trees, a lean-to shed was destroyed and a pivot overturned. As for the hail, the largest reported was 3 diameter between Clay Center and Harvard, but towns including Sutton and Nelson endured stones to at least tennis ball size. Flooding was not much of an issue, as the storm was progressive enough to keep rainfall amounts largely under one inch. ||Breaking down the meteorological background and event timing, this was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for South Central Nebraska, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C providing a healthy cap. On the other hand, low-level forcing was seasonably-strong, as a well-defined cold front slid southeastward into the area during the afternoon. Ahead of this boundary, a significantly-unstable airmass awaited, featuring temperatures in the upper 80s-low 90s F/dewpoints upper 60s-mid 70s F, yielding formidable mixed-layer CAPE around 4000 J/kg. This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection. As for what actually transpired, the main show was preceded by a broken line of non-severe, likely elevated storms that passed primarily through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 between 12:30-3:30 p.m. CDT. About the time this innocuous early afternoon activity was departing the local area to the southeast, a broken line of true, surface-based storms got going along the front in northeast Nebraska, with the southwestern-most cell building down into the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska (eastern Nance/northeast Merrick/northern Polk counties) between 3-4 p.m. CDT. Within an hour thereafter, this tail end Charlie storm rapidly grew into a full-blown supercell over Polk/northern York counties, producing its first marginally-severe hail reports. During the following two hours (5-7 p.m. CDT), the storm anchored itself firmly to the surface front, with new updraft generation along its western edge promoting more of a southwestward propagation and causing it to grow larger in both intensity/size, becoming more of a supercell cluster. It was during this time that the brief tornadoes occurred along the storm's far western flank, likely driven by pronounced low-level vorticity stretching along the surface front. While the sporadic tornado touchdowns were brief, the storm continued to be a prolific hail-producer as it gradually exited the local area out of Nuckolls County into northern Kansas between 7-8 p.m. CDT, ending all South Central Nebraska convection for the night.",A brief tornado continued from Hamilton County.

Although radar data suggested that spotty hail to at least nickel size likely occurred within various counties, ground-truth verification was quite limited, consisting of only a few reports of penny to quarter size stones in Hastings around 1:30 a.m. CDT, followed a short time later by the only severe-criteria report of the event: golf ball size hail at Inland in western Clay County. A few hours later (around 4 a.m. CDT), the final strong local storms of the morning dissipated over eastern Fillmore/Thayer counties. There were no reports of strong/severe wind gusts. ||This somewhat-unexpected nocturnal convection (at least in terms of intensity) initiated in the local area over Dawson County shortly before midnight CDT, roughly 50 miles east of a small cluster of strong storms already ongoing off to the west, and roughly 75-100 miles north of the centroid of a small mesoscale convective system (MCS) sliding across northern Kansas (in fact the local storms appeared to be a northward-displaced offshoot of the Kansas MCS). Whether or not the local convection was directly tied to the activity farther south, mesoscale analysis revealed that it was likely sparked by a subtle ribbon of low-mid level warm air/moisture advection within a weak southwesterly low level jet axis (winds at 850 millibars less than 25 knots). Convective parameters were at least marginally-supportive of sporadic intense updrafts, featuring around 1500 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and up to around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

In addition to dropping three fairly brief EF-0 tornadoes in southeastern Hamilton and northeastern Clay counties, its main calling card was large hail, with several reports of golf ball to slightly larger than baseball size stones in Clay/Nuckolls counties, and smaller hail to around quarter size as far north as Osceola. Interestingly, damaging winds were not a major player, with no ground-truth gusts in excess of 50 MPH. Focusing on specific storm reports, and starting with the three EF-0 tornadoes, they all occurred between 5-6 p.m. CDT, touching down briefly along a roughly 15-mile long corridor from near Interstate 80 a few miles south of Hampton, down to the Saronville area. Per storm surveys, the first two tornadoes were each on the ground for roughly 2 miles. While the majority of minor damage was confined to crops and trees, a lean-to shed was destroyed and a pivot overturned. As for the hail, the largest reported was 3 diameter between Clay Center and Harvard, but towns including Sutton and Nelson endured stones to at least tennis ball size. Flooding was not much of an issue, as the storm was progressive enough to keep rainfall amounts largely under one inch. ||Breaking down the meteorological background and event timing, this was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for South Central Nebraska, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C providing a healthy cap. On the other hand, low-level forcing was seasonably-strong, as a well-defined cold front slid southeastward into the area during the afternoon. Ahead of this boundary, a significantly-unstable airmass awaited, featuring temperatures in the upper 80s-low 90s F/dewpoints upper 60s-mid 70s F, yielding formidable mixed-layer CAPE around 4000 J/kg. This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection. As for what actually transpired, the main show was preceded by a broken line of non-severe, likely elevated storms that passed primarily through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 between 12:30-3:30 p.m. CDT. About the time this innocuous early afternoon activity was departing the local area to the southeast, a broken line of true, surface-based storms got going along the front in northeast Nebraska, with the southwestern-most cell building down into the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska (eastern Nance/northeast Merrick/northern Polk counties) between 3-4 p.m. CDT. Within an hour thereafter, this tail end Charlie storm rapidly grew into a full-blown supercell over Polk/northern York counties, producing its first marginally-severe hail reports. During the following two hours (5-7 p.m. CDT), the storm anchored itself firmly to the surface front, with new updraft generation along its western edge promoting more of a southwestward propagation and causing it to grow larger in both intensity/size, becoming more of a supercell cluster.

Of the counties impacted by this supercell, Jewell was hardest-hit, as copious amounts of tennis ball to softball size hail stones crashed down onto areas in and near the communities of Mankato and Jewell, causing extensive damage to homes, vehicles and area crops. The hail size toned down somewhat farther south into Mitchell and Osborne counties, where limited reports included ping pong ball size stones in Cawker City and golf ball size south of Osborne. Although damaging winds were not a major player during this event, several mesonets clocked gusts of at least 40-50 MPH, and a Kansas Mesonet site near Jewell reached severe-criteria with 65 MPH.

In addition to dropping three fairly brief EF-0 tornadoes in southeastern Hamilton and northeastern Clay counties, its main calling card was large hail, with several reports of golf ball to slightly larger than baseball size stones in Clay/Nuckolls counties, and smaller hail to around quarter size as far north as Osceola. Interestingly, damaging winds were not a major player, with no ground-truth gusts in excess of 50 MPH. Focusing on specific storm reports, and starting with the three EF-0 tornadoes, they all occurred between 5-6 p.m. CDT, touching down briefly along a roughly 15-mile long corridor from near Interstate 80 a few miles south of Hampton, down to the Saronville area. Per storm surveys, the first two tornadoes were each on the ground for roughly 2 miles.

Whether or not the local convection was directly tied to the activity farther south, mesoscale analysis revealed that it was likely sparked by a subtle ribbon of low-mid level warm air/moisture advection within a weak southwesterly low level jet axis (winds at 850 millibars less than 25 knots).

The most telling personal evidence of heat burst activity came from Rooks County State Park, where a man relayed an account of being caught off guard by a low roaring sound followed by several minutes of strong winds he estimated to be at least 70 MPH, which damaged some trees. He noted how unusual the situation was given the lack of obvious thunderstorm activity in the immediate area.

The cold front already had a history of producing severe caliber, non-thunderstorm, straight line winds over western and central Nebraska, and this trend continued along and just behind the cold front as it marched through south central Nebraska. The strongest winds, initially, were focused roughly along an area from Furnas County northeast into Buffalo County, where measured and estimated wind gusts of 55-65 mph were fairly common. Damage reports from these areas were fairly typical for winds of this magnitude and mainly limited to tree and power line damage. By 7:30pm CDT, an area of showers and thunderstorms developed along and just behind the cold front over Kearney and Franklin Counties as the cold front continued to progress east. This activity reached roughly the Highway 281 corridor from Grand Island to Hastings around 8pm CDT. Wind gusts associated with the passage of the cold front had weakened slightly by this time, but were still quite strong around 50-55 mph, with mainly minor tree damage and power outages reported in the Tri Cities. After 8pm CDT, the area of thunderstorms began to expand northeast and connected up with existing thunderstorms that had already developed along the cold front over northeast and east central Nebraska, essentially filling in a gap that had existed in between the two thunderstorm clusters. Thunderstorm intensity increased just east of Hastings between 8pm CDT and 8:30pm CDT, such that the wind gusts produced by the thunderstorms exacerbated the already-high ambient synoptically driven non-thunderstorm wind gusts associated with the cold front. This resulted in the strongest wind gusts of the evening, generally 60 to 70mph, in a swath that covered portions of Clay, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Significant tree damage occurred in these areas, along with damage to a few empty grain bins. Another significant impact, albeit somewhat less obvious or common than typical tree/power line damage, was blowing dust and corn stalks (this event occurred during the harvest season) that led to reduced visibility and ultimately contributed to a four-vehicle accident along Highway 81 just north of Bruning. Another incidence of poor visibility caused a vehicle to leave the roadway in Clay County. ||The highest wind gust with this event was 71 mph, measured by a mesonet station in Thayer County. As mentioned above, the damaging wind events in the eastern half of the CWA were largely driven by convective winds that enhanced already-high ambient winds. Farther west, the severe wind was non-convective and driven by intense pressure rises behind the cold front on the order of 3-5 mb/2 hrs. Overall, this event was one of the more significant wind events of the season and was somewhat unique due to the narrow overlap, spatially and temporally, of both convective and non-convective damaging winds.",Wind gusts estimated to be near 60 MPH caused minor tree damage and downed power lines in Clay Center.,CSV

Wind gusts associated with the passage of the cold front had weakened slightly by this time, but were still quite strong around 50-55 mph, with mainly minor tree damage and power outages reported in the Tri Cities. After 8pm CDT, the area of thunderstorms began to expand northeast and connected up with existing thunderstorms that had already developed along the cold front over northeast and east central Nebraska, essentially filling in a gap that had existed in between the two thunderstorm clusters. Thunderstorm intensity increased just east of Hastings between 8pm CDT and 8:30pm CDT, such that the wind gusts produced by the thunderstorms exacerbated the already-high ambient synoptically driven non-thunderstorm wind gusts associated with the cold front. This resulted in the strongest wind gusts of the evening, generally 60 to 70mph, in a swath that covered portions of Clay, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Significant tree damage occurred in these areas, along with damage to a few empty grain bins. Another significant impact, albeit somewhat less obvious or common than typical tree/power line damage, was blowing dust and corn stalks (this event occurred during the harvest season) that led to reduced visibility and ultimately contributed to a four-vehicle accident along Highway 81 just north of Bruning. Another incidence of poor visibility caused a vehicle to leave the roadway in Clay County. ||The highest wind gust with this event was 71 mph, measured by a mesonet station in Thayer County. As mentioned above, the damaging wind events in the eastern half of the CWA were largely driven by convective winds that enhanced already-high ambient winds. Farther west, the severe wind was non-convective and driven by intense pressure rises behind the cold front on the order of 3-5 mb/2 hrs. Overall, this event was one of the more significant wind events of the season and was somewhat unique due to the narrow overlap, spatially and temporally, of both convective and non-convective damaging winds.",Wind gusts estimated to be near 60 MPH resulted in downed powerlines at the intersection of Highway 6 and Highway 283.,CSV

During the first round, one storm briefly pulsed up to severe levels over Polk County around 4:30 p.m. CDT, as estimated 60 MPH winds felled a large tree branch onto an attached garage in Osceola. Elsewhere in the area, a few near-severe-criteria storm reports included: 54 MPH gusts near Oxford (during the second round of storms), 52 MPH at York airport and penny to nickel size hail in Fillmore County. ||The first round of isolated to scattered convection affected mainly the northeastern one-third of the local area (primarily east of a Greeley-Aurora-Hebron line), first entering counties such as Greeley/Nance between 3-4 p.m. CDT and exiting Fillmore/Thayer counties between 6-7 p.m. CDT. Meanwhile, the second round of storms arrived a bit later and farther west (mainly affecting areas southwest of a Loup City-Hastings-Superior line), entering Dawson/Buffalo counties between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT and exiting southward into Kansas between 8-9 p.m. CDT. Long before reaching South Central Nebraska, both rounds of convection initiated well to the north-northwest (near the NE-SD border) early in the afternoon. This was a fairly classic northwest-flow-aloft event, as the Central Plains resided within the path of several small-scale disturbances tracking southeastward around the periphery of a larger-scale trough centered over south central Canada. Despite only modest low-level moisture in the wake of a secondary cold front, this convection made the most of steep low-level lapse rates and seasonably-cool mid level temps, with mid-late afternoon mesoscale parameters in South Central Nebraska featuring 1000-1500 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 25-35 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

This front entered western portions of the Hastings NWS county warning area (CWA) around 7pm CDT. The cold front already had a history of producing severe caliber, non-thunderstorm, straight line winds over western and central Nebraska, and this trend continued along and just behind the cold front as it marched through south central Nebraska. The strongest winds, initially, were focused roughly along an area from Furnas County northeast into Buffalo County, where measured and estimated wind gusts of 55-65 mph were fairly common. Damage reports from these areas were fairly typical for winds of this magnitude and mainly limited to tree and power line damage. By 7:30pm CDT, an area of showers and thunderstorms developed along and just behind the cold front over Kearney and Franklin Counties as the cold front continued to progress east. This activity reached roughly the Highway 281 corridor from Grand Island to Hastings around 8pm CDT. Wind gusts associated with the passage of the cold front had weakened slightly by this time, but were still quite strong around 50-55 mph, with mainly minor tree damage and power outages reported in the Tri Cities. After 8pm CDT, the area of thunderstorms began to expand northeast and connected up with existing thunderstorms that had already developed along the cold front over northeast and east central Nebraska, essentially filling in a gap that had existed in between the two thunderstorm clusters. Thunderstorm intensity increased just east of Hastings between 8pm CDT and 8:30pm CDT, such that the wind gusts produced by the thunderstorms exacerbated the already-high ambient synoptically driven non-thunderstorm wind gusts associated with the cold front. This resulted in the strongest wind gusts of the evening, generally 60 to 70mph, in a swath that covered portions of Clay, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Significant tree damage occurred in these areas, along with damage to a few empty grain bins. Another significant impact, albeit somewhat less obvious or common than typical tree/power line damage, was blowing dust and corn stalks (this event occurred during the harvest season) that led to reduced visibility and ultimately contributed to a four-vehicle accident along Highway 81 just north of Bruning.

At the surface, a fairly well-defined warm front blasted north across Nebraska over the course of the day. In the mid-upper levels, flow was fairly anemic over the local area as ridging prevailed aloft, downstream from a potent shortwave trough ejecting north-northeast across the Intermountain West.

Later, quarter size stones fell from other storms at Wood River, Genoa and Silver Creek, although the late-night report from Silver Creek implied that much larger hail might have transpired (observer unable to confirm a maximum size). ||Isolated storms first drifted into western portions of the 24-county area between 6-8 p.m. CDT, after initiating a few hours prior in west-central Nebraska along a north-south oriented surface trough.

Between 8-11 p.m. CDT the vast majority of limited storm activity was rather weak, with the main exception of the briefly-severe storm that produced the 1-inch hail in Hall County. Then, about the time it appeared that any severe threat had ended for the night, a small cluster of storms began intensifying over eastern Nance County around midnight CDT, likely in response to the onset of a fairly weak southwesterly low level jet. Over the next few hours, this convection briefly morphed into a supercell that drifted southeast across portions of Nance, Merrick and Polk counties (yielding the Genoa and Silver Creek hail reports) before departing the local area around 2 a.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was provided by a low-amplitude shortwave trough translating across Nebraska in west-northwest flow, well-south of a larger-scale trough anchored over south central Canada.

This front entered western portions of north central Kansas between 7pm and 8pm CDT. The cold front already had a history of producing severe caliber, non-thunderstorm, straight line winds over western Nebraska and Kansas, and this trend continued along and just behind the cold front as it marched through north central Kansas. There were several reports of wind gusts of 60 to 65 mph across Phillips, Smith, and Osborne Counties. Damage reports from these areas were fairly typical for winds of this magnitude and mainly limited to tree and power line damage. Thunderstorms began to develop along the cold front as it moved farther east into Jewell County between 8:30pm and 9pm CDT. Thunderstorm intensity increased between 9pm CDT and 9:30pm CDT, such that the wind gusts produced by the thunderstorms enhanced the already-high ambient synoptically driven non-thunderstorm wind gusts associated with the cold front. This resulted in additional 60 to 65 mph wind gusts across portions of Jewell County. No specific damage reports were received from this area. Wind gusts decreased as thunderstorms exited Jewell County by 10pm CDT.||As mentioned above, the damaging wind events in the eastern half of north central Kansas were largely driven by convective winds that enhanced already-high ambient winds. Farther west, the severe wind was non-convective and driven by intense pressure rises behind the cold front on the order of 3-5 mb per 2 hrs. This event was somewhat unique due to the narrow overlap, spatially and temporally, of both convective and non-convective damaging winds.",A wind gust of 64 MPH was recorded by a mesonet station located 1 mile west of Logan.,CSV

These initial storms included the one that produced the large hail in Furnas County. Between 8-11 p.m. CDT the vast majority of limited storm activity was rather weak, with the main exception of the briefly-severe storm that produced the 1-inch hail in Hall County. Then, about the time it appeared that any severe threat had ended for the night, a small cluster of storms began intensifying over eastern Nance County around midnight CDT, likely in response to the onset of a fairly weak southwesterly low level jet. Over the next few hours, this convection briefly morphed into a supercell that drifted southeast across portions of Nance, Merrick and Polk counties (yielding the Genoa and Silver Creek hail reports) before departing the local area around 2 a.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was provided by a low-amplitude shortwave trough translating across Nebraska in west-northwest flow, well-south of a larger-scale trough anchored over south central Canada.

The cold front already had a history of producing severe caliber, non-thunderstorm, straight line winds over western Nebraska and Kansas, and this trend continued along and just behind the cold front as it marched through north central Kansas. There were several reports of wind gusts of 60 to 65 mph across Phillips, Smith, and Osborne Counties.

Thunderstorms began to develop along the cold front as it moved farther east into Jewell County between 8:30pm and 9pm CDT. Thunderstorm intensity increased between 9pm CDT and 9:30pm CDT, such that the wind gusts produced by the thunderstorms enhanced the already-high ambient synoptically driven non-thunderstorm wind gusts associated with the cold front. This resulted in additional 60 to 65 mph wind gusts across portions of Jewell County. No specific damage reports were received from this area. Wind gusts decreased as thunderstorms exited Jewell County by 10pm CDT.||As mentioned above, the damaging wind events in the eastern half of north central Kansas were largely driven by convective winds that enhanced already-high ambient winds. Farther west, the severe wind was non-convective and driven by intense pressure rises behind the cold front on the order of 3-5 mb per 2 hrs.

As for how the day played out, this seemed to be a case where factors such as the presence of early-day convection in/near the area, along with appreciable high level cloud cover much of the day, combined to hamper later-day airmass recovery and thus tempered the magnitude of the potential severe threat (SPC had upgraded most of South Central Nebraska to Enhanced Risk on morning Day 1 outlooks). ||The first sign of potential complications showed its hand early in the day as a few clusters of elevated, non-severe storms flared up between sunrise and late morning, affecting several counties along/east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, an unrelated batch of higher clouds rolled in from the west, prompting a multi-hour period of mostly cloudy skies over South Central Nebraska lasting well into the afternoon. Then, as skies started clearing and airmass recovery began, an extensive batch of strong/severe convection erupted to the south over Kansas, likely disrupting northward moisture advection and further inhibiting late afternoon destabilization.

However, these storms did not maintain intensity long, weakening within 60-90 minutes. In their wake, one more rogue severe storm flared up around 8:30 p.m. CDT over Phelps/Harlan counties, but also faded fast. Finally, shortly after sunset a briefly-severe storm just west of the local area made a run toward Dawson County, but weakened as it moved in, effectively slamming the door on any further severe threat. Not surprisingly given the forecast expectations, the general synoptic setup appeared rather solid for severe storms.

Some of these thunderstorms became severe, bringing scattered instances of large hail, along with isolated severe wind. The first thunderstorm formed over Dawson County, just behind the cold front, around 8pm, and produced quarter size hail just north of Sumner. This storm continued to produce severe hail as it moved northeast into Custer County between 8pm and 9pm. A more extensive line of thunderstorms developed farther east around 8:30pm, from eastern Buffalo County northeast to Greeley County. This line moved east southeast. Southern portions of the line were the most intense and produced a swath of large hail reports ranging from quarter size up to half dollar size from Cairo into Grand Island. A severe wind gust of 62 mph was also measured at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (KGRI). The line of thunderstorms continued east southeast, affecting areas east of Highway 281 and north of Highway 6 between 9:45pm and midnight. However, no additional severe reports were received within these areas during this time.||The thunderstorms were supported by strong instability (mixed layer CAPE values of 4500-5500 J/kg) and modest effective shear (25-35kt). Steep mid level lapse rates near 8 C/km and a glancing influence from a progressive shortwave moving from Colorado into Nebraska Panhandle also aided in severe thunderstorm formation, though the position of this upper disturbance  kept the greatest deep layer shear displaced northwest from the cold front and strongest instability.

But for the majority of the area this was just a classic, stormy early-summer night (most places measured between 0.50-2.00 inches of rain). As for the handful of severe weather reports, the main issue was a brief burst of intense winds through Rooks County around 2 a.m. CDT, including measured unofficial gusts of 68 MPH north-northeast of Codell, 62 MPH in Stockton and 61 MPH at Plainville (no known damage reports). Hail-wise, the only report featured quarter size stones east of Phillipsburg shortly after 11 p.m. CDT. Regarding heavy rainfall/flooding, primarily northeast Mitchell County was drenched with multiple downpours between midnight-4 a.m. CDT, with several automated gauges and NWS/CoCoRaHS observers tallying 3-5, including 5.05 just northeast of Beloit (unofficial public report of 6 at Simpson). This prompted relatively minor/short-term flash flooding and areal flooding, and also drove the Solomon River out of its banks as the Beloit gauge crested around 22.4 feet on the afternoon of the 27th (flood stage 20 feet). ||Timing-wise, there were basically two main rounds of convection. The first round (mainly 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. CDT) featured generally isolated to scattered coverage, as storms developed directly overhead in response to the onset of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars). Then, primarily 2-4 a.m. CDT the next round charged in from the west in the form of a fairly compact linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that had gotten its act together well before midnight along the KS/CO border. By 4 a.m. CDT, storm intensity had waned considerably across local counties, although mainly stratiform lighter rain held on through around sunrise. This was a fairly typical setup for active nocturnal storms in the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, broad zonal flow reigned as a low amplitude wave rode eastward out of CO during the night. Meanwhile at the surface, a nearly stationary front resided directly through the area in east-northeast to west-southwest fashion, as evening dewpoints averaged mid-60s to around 70 F. Though fairly warm mid-level temps/weak capping held storms at bay until after sunset, the onset of the low level jet easily sparked convection given a healthy reservoir of 2000-3000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, with the main limiting factor to a more robust severe threat being only modest deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots.","Widespread rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches were reported across the area, with the primary impact being numerous rural roads being covered in water and closed.",CSV

This was due to variances in the placement of two primary, generally west-east oriented snow bands: 1) a northern band that spread amounts of 3-5 (isolated higher) across Valley/Greeley/northern Nance counties...2) a southern band that brought totals of generally 2-4 (isolated higher) to locations roughly 15-25 miles either side of line from Beaver City-Hastings. Within these two main stripes, a sampling of the highest CoCoRaHS/NWS cooperative reports featured: 6 nine miles northwest of Ord and also at Wilsonville, 5 In Ord and near Wilcox, 4.5 eight miles north-northeast of Scotia, 4 in Spalding, 3.7 six miles south of Beaver City and 3.5 in Minden. In contrast, most locations outside these bands (including between them) only tallied around 1 or less (including at Grand Island, York, St. Paul, Central City, Superior and Hebron). Winds during this event were not overly-strong, but still enough to promote modest travel impacts from blowing snow/minor drifting thanks to sustained speeds generally 10-20 MPH/gusts up to around 30 MPH. While snow was clearly the main precipitation type, some areas also noted a light glaze of freezing drizzle (mainly on elevated surfaces). ||Although this was a somewhat-prolonged snow event for South Central Nebraska as a whole, it certainly did not snow area-wide the entire time, as the varied timing/placement of banding brought accumulation to some places well before others. Within the northern band north of Interstate 80, the majority of accumulation occurred on-and-off between the evening of the 24th and the late afternoon of the 25th. Meanwhile, within the southern band the majority of snow got underway on the evening of the 25th and peaked in intensity overnight before diminishing by daybreak on the 26th.

In the mid-upper levels, the main forcing behind this early-season event stemmed from a series of small-scale disturbances/ribbons of mid-level saturation/frontogenesis zipping across the Central Plains in active west-southwest flow, focused out ahead of (south of) a large-scale, positively-tilted trough sinking slowly south-southeastward through the Northern/Central Rockies and Northern Plains. At the surface, the steady north-northeast breezes were largely driven by pressure rises emanating from a strong/expansive ridge axis migrating from the Northern Rockies on the morning of the 25th to the Nebraska area on the morning of the 26th (central pressure by this time around 1034 millibars). From a temperature standpoint, this snow event occurred right in the middle of what ended up being the overall-coldest week on record to occur so early in the fall season (per long-term historical data at both Grand Island and Hastings).

However, these initially semi-discrete storms (which accounted for all large hail reports) quickly consolidated/grew upscale into a new linear MCS that charged north-northeast across the Highway 6/Interstate 80 corridors between 1-2 a.m. CDT, gradually merging with the initial MCS racing up from the southwest in the process. During the ensuing hour, the two complexes completed a full merger; the northern end weakening as it reached far northeastern counties (such as Nance/Polk), while the southern end remained severe through Fillmore/Thayer counties before departing the local area into southeast Nebraska. This ended any severe threat for the night, although weaker storms and broader showers persisted until around sunrise in some spots. This was a ripe setup for severe nocturnal storms, especially with the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) aimed into the heart of South Central Nebraska after dark, and tapping into a large reservoir of most-unstable CAPE as high as 2000-3000 J/kg. In the mid-upper levels, flow over the region was not overly-strong, but contained various low-amplitude disturbances and was in the process of transitioning more southwesterly in response to a larger-scale trough setting up over the northwestern United States. There were no distinct surface features across the local area, but steady light southeast breezes prior to storm initiation maintained seasonably-high dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70 F. Likely one of the main limiting factors against a more robust severe threat was only modest deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots.",,CSV

While most of this activity was sub-severe, a briefly-more-intense storm prompted a lone report of quarter size hail near Stamford around 10:45 p.m. CDT (penny size hail occurred in Beaver City shortly before this). ||Initially, South Central Nebraska remained mostly storm-free during the peak heating of late afternoon/early evening, but not by very far, as counties slightly to the west within southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas saw a few strong to severe storms develop near a slow-moving cold front. Eventually, between 8-10 p.m. CDT, a loosely-organized cluster of multicell convection that evolved from this early activity propagated east into far southwestern local counties. Then, between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT a few embedded cells intensified enough to prompt severe thunderstorm warnings for parts of Furnas/Harlan/Phelps counties (although the quarter size hail near Stamford was the only ground-truth verification). After midnight, the dominant cell within the cluster gradually weakened as it traversed parts of Franklin/Kearney counties, dissipating by 2 a.m. CDT over western Adams County. While the evening mesoscale environment in South Central Nebraska was obviously sufficient for a marginally-severe storm, it was not supportive of widespread severe activity given that respectable mixed-layer CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg was offset by weak deep-layer wind shear of no more than 25 knots. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided under fairly anemic quasi-zonal flow, as the primary upper jet (and resultant stronger shear) resided farther north over the Dakotas.",,CSV

Then, between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT a few embedded cells intensified enough to prompt severe thunderstorm warnings for parts of Furnas/Harlan/Phelps counties (although the quarter size hail near Stamford was the only ground-truth verification). After midnight, the dominant cell within the cluster gradually weakened as it traversed parts of Franklin/Kearney counties, dissipating by 2 a.m. CDT over western Adams County. While the evening mesoscale environment in South Central Nebraska was obviously sufficient for a marginally-severe storm, it was not supportive of widespread severe activity given that respectable mixed-layer CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg was offset by weak deep-layer wind shear of no more than 25 knots.

Overall, damaging winds were the bigger issue, highlighted by a measured gust of 79 MPH at the York airport shortly before 10 p.m. CDT. As these winds tore into town, they took down several large tree branches (a few entire trees), causing fairly widespread power outages and even partially-crushing an unoccupied car. About an hour before reaching York, measured winds of 70 MPH struck the Chapman area, flipping over irrigation pivots and taking down a light pole at a convenience store. Later in the evening, shortly before storms completely exited the local area, estimated 70 MPH winds took down a giant tree limb in Alexandria (3 ft. diameter/50 ft. long). Although the majority of wind damage focused within eastern counties, severe-criteria gusts were ongoing even as storms first entered the local area earlier in the evening, including 64 MPH at Ord airport.

However, for a relatively-focused zone within the heart of the area this was actually the fifth-straight dry month. As a result, the U.S. Drought Monitor continued an areal-expansion of both D2 Severe and D1 Moderate Drought during October. Focusing first on the D2 situation: as October began, D2 was already assigned to portions of nine counties in the center of the area (including all/nearly all of Kearney and Adams). Then a week later, portions of eight more counties joined the mix, including a westward extension of the initial D2 area to include sizable portions of counties such as Dawson/Gosper, and also a completely separate area of D2 farther north that encompassed the vast majority of Valley, Greeley, Sherman and Howard counties. Later in the month, a southward expansion of the southern D2 area brought most of Furnas County into the fold, resulting in a total of 18 counties at least partially-assigned Severe Drought by the end of the month. More specifically, the geographic coverage of D2 in South Central Nebraska ballooned from 9 to 37 percent during October. Outside of the worst-off D2 area, both D1 Moderate Drought and D0 Abnormally Dry also increased in coverage, with D1 introduced to all/most of York and Fillmore counties and D0 expanding to include the remainder of Thayer/Nuckolls counties. In other words, the entire 24-county area was assigned some U.S. Drought Monitor category by month's end. ||Taking a closer look at October precipitation, needless to say it was a notably-dry month: not only was the vast majority of the area below normal, but most of it tallied merely 10-50 percent of normal (normals generally 1.50-2.00). The overall-driest conditions concentrated near/south of Interstate 80, where NWS observer totals included a paltry 0.08 at Nelson, 0.11 eight miles south of Elwood (and also at Ravenna and Superior) and 0.12 at Red Cloud and Hebron. On the wetter side of things (but still below normal), parts of mainly far northern counties (such as Valley/Greeley) measured as much as 1.00-1.50, thanks mainly to early-season snowfall. Over the longer-term five-month period covering June-October, much of particularly the D2 areas only totaled 5-8 (generally 30-50% of normal). A few of the very driest NWS stations during this stretch included: Minden 5.08 (driest on record), Kearney airport 5.14 (3rd-driest), Hastings airport 5.87 (driest on record) and St. Paul 6.28 (3rd-driest). Temperature-wise, although October as a whole averaged 2-4 degrees F cooler-than-normal across South Central Nebraska (thanks mainly to a very cold late-month stretch), the first part of the month featured a blast of early-fall heat as highs in most places soared well into the 80s for a full week between the 5th-11th. Although no widespread/major drought impacts were noted locally during October, one indicator of the increasingly-dry conditions unfolded on the evening of the 11th as high winds prompted areas of blowing dust, greatly-reducing visibility and reportedly contributing to at least a few traffic accidents.",,CSV

Then a week later, portions of eight more counties joined the mix, including a westward extension of the initial D2 area to include sizable portions of counties such as Dawson/Gosper, and also a completely separate area of D2 farther north that encompassed the vast majority of Valley, Greeley, Sherman and Howard counties. Later in the month, a southward expansion of the southern D2 area brought most of Furnas County into the fold, resulting in a total of 18 counties at least partially-assigned Severe Drought by the end of the month. More specifically, the geographic coverage of D2 in South Central Nebraska ballooned from 9 to 37 percent during October. Outside of the worst-off D2 area, both D1 Moderate Drought and D0 Abnormally Dry also increased in coverage, with D1 introduced to all/most of York and Fillmore counties and D0 expanding to include the remainder of Thayer/Nuckolls counties. In other words, the entire 24-county area was assigned some U.S. Drought Monitor category by month's end. ||Taking a closer look at October precipitation, needless to say it was a notably-dry month: not only was the vast majority of the area below normal, but most of it tallied merely 10-50 percent of normal (normals generally 1.50-2.00).

Overall, damaging winds were the bigger issue, highlighted by a measured gust of 79 MPH at the York airport shortly before 10 p.m. CDT. As these winds tore into town, they took down several large tree branches (a few entire trees), causing fairly widespread power outages and even partially-crushing an unoccupied car. About an hour before reaching York, measured winds of 70 MPH struck the Chapman area, flipping over irrigation pivots and taking down a light pole at a convenience store. Later in the evening, shortly before storms completely exited the local area, estimated 70 MPH winds took down a giant tree limb in Alexandria (3 ft. diameter/50 ft. long). Although the majority of wind damage focused within eastern counties, severe-criteria gusts were ongoing even as storms first entered the local area earlier in the evening, including 64 MPH at Ord airport.

The southern one, which had been occasionally severe over southwest Nebraska, lost some steam as it moved east, yielding only slightly sub-severe wind gust reports in Furnas County. Meanwhile, the northern storm complex clearly established itself as dominant, charging southeastward as damaging winds peaked in intensity between 8:30-11:30 p.m. CDT. Shortly before midnight, the back edge of the now linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) exited southeast out of Thayer County, ending all storm activity for the night. Turning to the meteorological setup, this was not a strongly-forced event, with the main feature in the mid-upper levels consisting of a low-amplitude shortwave trough tracking east-southeast across Nebraska out of western SD over the course of the afternoon-evening. Surface features across South Central Nebraska ahead of the storms were fairly nondescript, dominated by weak high pressure and southerly-to-easterly breezes only around 10 MPH or less. However, fairly steep low-mid level lapse rates were in place, with damaging wind potential likely enhanced by fairly large surface dewpoint depressions heading into the evening (on the order of 25-30 degrees F). Evening mesoscale analysis over South Central Nebraska revealed 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 35-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

However, between 10:30-11:15 p.m. CDT, one small storm cluster flared up to severe levels over Jewell County, yielding a lone ground-truth report of measured 68 MPH winds in the far northeast corner of the county near Webber. Radar also indicated that this storm might have produced severe-criteria hail over mainly central sections of the county, but there were no verifying reports. In the mid-upper levels, this was not a strongly-forced event, with the main feature consisting of a low-amplitude shortwave trough tracking east-southeast across Nebraska out of western SD over the course of the afternoon-evening. Surface features in North Central Kansas during the evening were fairly nondescript, dominated by weak high pressure and generally southerly breezes around 10 MPH or less.

At the surface, the associated low pressure center gradually intensified from around 994 millibars as it crossed Nebraska during the overnight-early morning of the 22nd-23rd, to 988 millibars by mid-day in the IA-MN-WI border area, and then maintained intensity while reaching Lake Superior overnight. Locally, the initial surge of strong northwest winds crossed South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn of the 23rd behind the main synoptic cold front, but gusts largely held under 50 MPH. The overall-strongest winds ended up occurring between mid-morning and mid-afternoon, corresponding to the peak surface pressure gradient between the departing/deepening low and strong high pressure nosing in from the west-northwest (for a few hours the west-to-east gradient across the state of Nebraska averaged near 25 millibars!) As for snowfall timing, an initial, narrow band swept across most of the area during the pre-dawn hours, but the primary, broad zone of mainly light-to-moderate snow (with brief heavier bursts) gradually overspread South Central Nebraska from west-northwest to east-southeast during the morning, eventually departing in similar fashion during the afternoon. Actual falling/accumulating snow ended across most of the area between 2-4 p.m., but lingering blowing snow and ground blizzard conditions held on for a few more hours...until gusts diminished more consistently to around 30 MPH-or-less after nightfall.

At the surface, the associated low pressure center gradually intensified from around 994 millibars as it crossed Nebraska during the overnight-early morning of the 22nd-23rd, to 988 millibars by mid-day in the IA-MN-WI border area, and then maintained intensity while reaching Lake Superior overnight. Locally, the initial surge of strong northwest winds crossed South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn of the 23rd behind the main synoptic cold front, but gusts largely held under 50 MPH. The overall-strongest winds ended up occurring between mid-morning and mid-afternoon, corresponding to the peak surface pressure gradient between the departing/deepening low and strong high pressure nosing in from the west-northwest (for a few hours the west-to-east gradient across the state of Nebraska averaged near 25 millibars!) As for snowfall timing, an initial, narrow band swept across most of the area during the pre-dawn hours, but the primary, broad zone of mainly light-to-moderate snow (with brief heavier bursts) gradually overspread South Central Nebraska from west-northwest to east-southeast during the morning, eventually departing in similar fashion during the afternoon. Actual falling/accumulating snow ended across most of the area between 2-4 p.m., but lingering blowing snow and ground blizzard conditions held on for a few more hours...until gusts diminished more consistently to around 30 MPH-or-less after nightfall. From a forecast review perspective, the intense winds and at least minor blowing snow impacts were fairly well-anticipated, as a High Wind Warning was issued for the entire area 12-18 hours in advance and a Winter Weather Advisory (for the majority of the area) was issued 6-18 hours out. However, especially the southward extent of accumulating snow and the resultant potential for all-out blizzard conditions was not as well foreseen (especially as far south as the Interstate 80/Highway 6 corridors), with several counties not placed under official Blizzard Warnings until rather late in the game.

At the surface, the associated low pressure center gradually intensified from around 994 millibars as it crossed Nebraska during the overnight-early morning of the 22nd-23rd, to 988 millibars by mid-day in the IA-MN-WI border area, and then maintained intensity while reaching Lake Superior overnight. Locally, the initial surge of strong northwest winds crossed South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn of the 23rd behind the main synoptic cold front, but gusts largely held under 50 MPH. The overall-strongest winds ended up occurring between mid-morning and mid-afternoon, corresponding to the peak surface pressure gradient between the departing/deepening low and strong high pressure nosing in from the west-northwest (for a few hours the west-to-east gradient across the state of Nebraska averaged near 25 millibars!) As for snowfall timing, an initial, narrow band swept across most of the area during the pre-dawn hours, but the primary, broad zone of mainly light-to-moderate snow (with brief heavier bursts) gradually overspread South Central Nebraska from west-northwest to east-southeast during the morning, eventually departing in similar fashion during the afternoon. Actual falling/accumulating snow ended across most of the area between 2-4 p.m., but lingering blowing snow and ground blizzard conditions held on for a few more hours...until gusts diminished more consistently to around 30 MPH-or-less after nightfall. From a forecast review perspective, the intense winds and at least minor blowing snow impacts were fairly well-anticipated, as a High Wind Warning was issued for the entire area 12-18 hours in advance and a Winter Weather Advisory (for the majority of the area) was issued 6-18 hours out.

Various law enforcement agencies reported dozens of traffic accidents and slide-offs (fortunately none fatal within the local area) and the following main highways were reported closed at various times: Interstate 80 between York and Kearney, Highway 281 between Grand Island and Hastings, Highway 30 from Grand Island-Kearney, Highway 34 from Grand Island-York, Highway 6 from Hastings-Kenesaw and Highway 81 near Shelby (all had re-opened by late afternoon).

As for areal coverage of white-out conditions, the worst/longest-lasting issues focused within counties both along/north of Highway 6 and also along/east of Highway 183 (including the Tri Cities). Within this area, most places endured at least semi-frequent blizzard conditions for 6-8 hours while accumulating 1-3 of snow, while far northern counties (such as Valley/Greeley) saw blizzard conditions for as long as 10-12 hours and received slightly-higher snow amounts up to 3-4. Meanwhile, the situation was not as severe within far southern/southwest counties especially near the Kansas border, where snow was lighter/less-intense compared to farther north (amounts mainly under 1) and didn't last as long. Although the magnitude of wintry precipitation/blizzard impacts varied somewhat across South Central Nebraska, all 24 counties dealt with at least 9-12 hours of feisty northwest winds, commonly sustained 30-40 MPH and gusting 45-60+ MPH.

While there were no known reports of substantial wind damage, NWS observers near both Arcadia and Shelby noted that several small tree branches were downed. ||Getting into more detail regarding event timing and meteorological background, the main driving force in the mid-upper levels was the passage of a deep, slightly-positively-tilted trough, with its primary vorticity maximum tracking from the Central Rockies on the evening of the 22nd, and then across the heart of Nebraska-Kansas during the day on the 23rd before departing into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes through the evening-overnight. At the surface, the associated low pressure center gradually intensified from around 994 millibars as it crossed Nebraska during the overnight-early morning of the 22nd-23rd, to 988 millibars by mid-day in the IA-MN-WI border area, and then maintained intensity while reaching Lake Superior overnight. Locally, the initial surge of strong northwest winds crossed South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn of the 23rd behind the main synoptic cold front, but gusts largely held under 50 MPH. The overall-strongest winds ended up occurring between mid-morning and mid-afternoon, corresponding to the peak surface pressure gradient between the departing/deepening low and strong high pressure nosing in from the west-northwest (for a few hours the west-to-east gradient across the state of Nebraska averaged near 25 millibars!) As for snowfall timing, an initial, narrow band swept across most of the area during the pre-dawn hours, but the primary, broad zone of mainly light-to-moderate snow (with brief heavier bursts) gradually overspread South Central Nebraska from west-northwest to east-southeast during the morning, eventually departing in similar fashion during the afternoon. Actual falling/accumulating snow ended across most of the area between 2-4 p.m., but lingering blowing snow and ground blizzard conditions held on for a few more hours...until gusts diminished more consistently to around 30 MPH-or-less after nightfall. From a forecast review perspective, the intense winds and at least minor blowing snow impacts were fairly well-anticipated, as a High Wind Warning was issued for the entire area 12-18 hours in advance and a Winter Weather Advisory (for the majority of the area) was issued 6-18 hours out.

While there were no known reports of substantial wind damage, NWS observers near both Arcadia and Shelby noted that several small tree branches were downed. ||Getting into more detail regarding event timing and meteorological background, the main driving force in the mid-upper levels was the passage of a deep, slightly-positively-tilted trough, with its primary vorticity maximum tracking from the Central Rockies on the evening of the 22nd, and then across the heart of Nebraska-Kansas during the day on the 23rd before departing into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes through the evening-overnight. At the surface, the associated low pressure center gradually intensified from around 994 millibars as it crossed Nebraska during the overnight-early morning of the 22nd-23rd, to 988 millibars by mid-day in the IA-MN-WI border area, and then maintained intensity while reaching Lake Superior overnight. Locally, the initial surge of strong northwest winds crossed South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn of the 23rd behind the main synoptic cold front, but gusts largely held under 50 MPH. The overall-strongest winds ended up occurring between mid-morning and mid-afternoon, corresponding to the peak surface pressure gradient between the departing/deepening low and strong high pressure nosing in from the west-northwest (for a few hours the west-to-east gradient across the state of Nebraska averaged near 25 millibars!) As for snowfall timing, an initial, narrow band swept across most of the area during the pre-dawn hours, but the primary, broad zone of mainly light-to-moderate snow (with brief heavier bursts) gradually overspread South Central Nebraska from west-northwest to east-southeast during the morning, eventually departing in similar fashion during the afternoon. Actual falling/accumulating snow ended across most of the area between 2-4 p.m., but lingering blowing snow and ground blizzard conditions held on for a few more hours...until gusts diminished more consistently to around 30 MPH-or-less after nightfall. From a forecast review perspective, the intense winds and at least minor blowing snow impacts were fairly well-anticipated, as a High Wind Warning was issued for the entire area 12-18 hours in advance and a Winter Weather Advisory (for the majority of the area) was issued 6-18 hours out. However, especially the southward extent of accumulating snow and the resultant potential for all-out blizzard conditions was not as well foreseen (especially as far south as the Interstate 80/Highway 6 corridors), with several counties not placed under official Blizzard Warnings until rather late in the game.

Within the western counties that received the most snow, the majority of accumulation occurred by noon, but at least occasional light snow/flurries hung around until late in the afternoon. In the mid-upper levels, the main player behind this relatively low-key snow event was a shortwave trough traversing eastward across the central United States, but with the primary closed low/vorticity maximum focused a bit south of the local area, generally along the Kansas-Oklahoma border.

Any steadier/measurable precipitation gradually departed the majority of the local area from west-to-east between sunrise and noon, although pesky light freezing drizzle hung around in some places until early evening.

Various law enforcement agencies reported dozens of traffic accidents and slide-offs (fortunately none fatal within the local area) and the following main highways were reported closed at various times: Interstate 80 between York and Kearney, Highway 281 between Grand Island and Hastings, Highway 30 from Grand Island-Kearney, Highway 34 from Grand Island-York, Highway 6 from Hastings-Kenesaw and Highway 81 near Shelby (all had re-opened by late afternoon). In Adams County, snowplows were pulled off the road for several hours due to very poor visibility. As for areal coverage of white-out conditions, the worst/longest-lasting issues focused within counties both along/north of Highway 6 and also along/east of Highway 183 (including the Tri Cities). Within this area, most places endured at least semi-frequent blizzard conditions for 6-8 hours while accumulating 1-3 of snow, while far northern counties (such as Valley/Greeley) saw blizzard conditions for as long as 10-12 hours and received slightly-higher snow amounts up to 3-4. Meanwhile, the situation was not as severe within far southern/southwest counties especially near the Kansas border, where snow was lighter/less-intense compared to farther north (amounts mainly under 1) and didn't last as long. Although the magnitude of wintry precipitation/blizzard impacts varied somewhat across South Central Nebraska, all 24 counties dealt with at least 9-12 hours of feisty northwest winds, commonly sustained 30-40 MPH and gusting 45-60+ MPH. A few of the highest official peak gusts at airports included: 76 MPH at Ord and 61 MPH at Grand Island, Hastings and York. While there were no known reports of substantial wind damage, NWS observers near both Arcadia and Shelby noted that several small tree branches were downed. ||Getting into more detail regarding event timing and meteorological background, the main driving force in the mid-upper levels was the passage of a deep, slightly-positively-tilted trough, with its primary vorticity maximum tracking from the Central Rockies on the evening of the 22nd, and then across the heart of Nebraska-Kansas during the day on the 23rd before departing into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes through the evening-overnight. At the surface, the associated low pressure center gradually intensified from around 994 millibars as it crossed Nebraska during the overnight-early morning of the 22nd-23rd, to 988 millibars by mid-day in the IA-MN-WI border area, and then maintained intensity while reaching Lake Superior overnight. Locally, the initial surge of strong northwest winds crossed South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn of the 23rd behind the main synoptic cold front, but gusts largely held under 50 MPH. The overall-strongest winds ended up occurring between mid-morning and mid-afternoon, corresponding to the peak surface pressure gradient between the departing/deepening low and strong high pressure nosing in from the west-northwest (for a few hours the west-to-east gradient across the state of Nebraska averaged near 25 millibars!) As for snowfall timing, an initial, narrow band swept across most of the area during the pre-dawn hours, but the primary, broad zone of mainly light-to-moderate snow (with brief heavier bursts) gradually overspread South Central Nebraska from west-northwest to east-southeast during the morning, eventually departing in similar fashion during the afternoon.

Various law enforcement agencies reported dozens of traffic accidents and slide-offs (fortunately none fatal within the local area) and the following main highways were reported closed at various times: Interstate 80 between York and Kearney, Highway 281 between Grand Island and Hastings, Highway 30 from Grand Island-Kearney, Highway 34 from Grand Island-York, Highway 6 from Hastings-Kenesaw and Highway 81 near Shelby (all had re-opened by late afternoon). In Adams County, snowplows were pulled off the road for several hours due to very poor visibility. As for areal coverage of white-out conditions, the worst/longest-lasting issues focused within counties both along/north of Highway 6 and also along/east of Highway 183 (including the Tri Cities). Within this area, most places endured at least semi-frequent blizzard conditions for 6-8 hours while accumulating 1-3 of snow, while far northern counties (such as Valley/Greeley) saw blizzard conditions for as long as 10-12 hours and received slightly-higher snow amounts up to 3-4. Meanwhile, the situation was not as severe within far southern/southwest counties especially near the Kansas border, where snow was lighter/less-intense compared to farther north (amounts mainly under 1) and didn't last as long. Although the magnitude of wintry precipitation/blizzard impacts varied somewhat across South Central Nebraska, all 24 counties dealt with at least 9-12 hours of feisty northwest winds, commonly sustained 30-40 MPH and gusting 45-60+ MPH.

While there were no known reports of substantial wind damage, NWS observers near both Arcadia and Shelby noted that several small tree branches were downed. ||Getting into more detail regarding event timing and meteorological background, the main driving force in the mid-upper levels was the passage of a deep, slightly-positively-tilted trough, with its primary vorticity maximum tracking from the Central Rockies on the evening of the 22nd, and then across the heart of Nebraska-Kansas during the day on the 23rd before departing into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes through the evening-overnight. At the surface, the associated low pressure center gradually intensified from around 994 millibars as it crossed Nebraska during the overnight-early morning of the 22nd-23rd, to 988 millibars by mid-day in the IA-MN-WI border area, and then maintained intensity while reaching Lake Superior overnight. Locally, the initial surge of strong northwest winds crossed South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn of the 23rd behind the main synoptic cold front, but gusts largely held under 50 MPH. The overall-strongest winds ended up occurring between mid-morning and mid-afternoon, corresponding to the peak surface pressure gradient between the departing/deepening low and strong high pressure nosing in from the west-northwest (for a few hours the west-to-east gradient across the state of Nebraska averaged near 25 millibars!) As for snowfall timing, an initial, narrow band swept across most of the area during the pre-dawn hours, but the primary, broad zone of mainly light-to-moderate snow (with brief heavier bursts) gradually overspread South Central Nebraska from west-northwest to east-southeast during the morning, eventually departing in similar fashion during the afternoon.
