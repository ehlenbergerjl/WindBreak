The impact of the widespread heavy icing was fairly limited for several reasons. Traffic was very limited because the day was a holiday, and because some businesses closings and activity cancellations were announced ahead of the storm. Winds remained light, limiting the breakage of ice covered trees and power lines. There were several vehicle accidents, but they were not numerous in any given area.","Freezing rain of over a quarter inch caused icy roads, and accumulated on trees, power lines, and other surfaces. Concord reported 0.37 inch of rain during a time when temperatures were at or below freezing, and Newcastle reported 0.32 inch.

West-northwest winds were sustained between 30 and 40 mph, mainly along and south of Interstate 80. Wind gusts around 55 mph were common. However, at times, some locations measured sustained winds around 45 mph, with gusts to 60 mph. The highest gust observed was 63 mph near Kearney. Blowing dust was visible everywhere, generally reducing the visibility to 3 to 7 miles. There were some very localized areas that experienced severely reduced visibility to one quarter mile or less, including on Interstate 80 between Grand Island and Kearney. Near zero visibility 8 miles south of Hastings resulted in a six vehicle pileup. These extremely low visibilities were due the poor decision by some farmers to disc their fields. Satellite imagery showed the dust originated in eastern Colorado, and it was transported northeastward just ahead of a cold front. However, winds behind the front picked up additional dust. The last time dust reduced visibilities significantly, in south central Nebraska, was in October 2012. These high winds combined with extremely low relative humidity (RH) values to create dangerous fire weather conditions. Afternoon minimum RH values were between 10 and 15%. Two wild fires occurred in Clay and Nuckolls Counties. Each fire was a few hundred acre fires and multiple fire departments responded. No structures were affected.||At dawn, a deep low pressure system (983 mb) was over South Dakota with a warm front extending east into the Great Lakes, and a cold front extending southwest to Arizona.

West-northwest winds were sustained between 30 and 40 mph, mainly along and south of Interstate 80. Wind gusts around 55 mph were common. However, at times, some locations measured sustained winds around 45 mph, with gusts to 60 mph. The highest gust observed was 63 mph near Kearney. Blowing dust was visible everywhere, generally reducing the visibility to 3 to 7 miles. There were some very localized areas that experienced severely reduced visibility to one quarter mile or less, including on Interstate 80 between Grand Island and Kearney. Near zero visibility 8 miles south of Hastings resulted in a six vehicle pileup. These extremely low visibilities were due the poor decision by some farmers to disc their fields. Satellite imagery showed the dust originated in eastern Colorado, and it was transported northeastward just ahead of a cold front. However, winds behind the front picked up additional dust. The last time dust reduced visibilities significantly, in south central Nebraska, was in October 2012. These high winds combined with extremely low relative humidity (RH) values to create dangerous fire weather conditions. Afternoon minimum RH values were between 10 and 15%. Two wild fires occurred in Clay and Nuckolls Counties. Each fire was a few hundred acre fires and multiple fire departments responded. No structures were affected.||At dawn, a deep low pressure system (983 mb) was over South Dakota with a warm front extending east into the Great Lakes, and a cold front extending southwest to Arizona. A dryline extended south into the warm sector, through western Nebraska and Kansas to New Mexico. As the day progressed, both the dryline and cold front swept through the region as the low occluded and deepened further to 978 mb. In the upper-levels, a trough was over the Western U.S., with a ridge in the East.

Some of the heaviest rain hit some of the most vulnerable parts of the city, namely Indian Creek near the Kansas and Missouri state line. in this location between 5 to 7 inches of rain fell over a roughly 3 hour period, causing Indian Creek at State Line Road to rise to 27.96 feet, a new record for that location. The result was businesses in that area becoming inundated with several feet of running water. Numerous car dealerships saw much of their merchandise go underwater at that location. A strip mall consisting of a restaurant among other businesses had water at least 6 feet deep. The restaurant owners tried to salvage their business, but had to flee to the roof in order to escape the rising waters around them. Local news televised a dramatic water rescue of the restaurant owners via motorized raft. Another site that had record flooding as a result of this event was Tomahawk Creek at Roe Avenue in Leawood. Tomahawk Creek crested at 20.81 feet, which was a new record for that location. Numerous city vehicles were damaged or destroyed when a lot near the creek containing those vehicles flooded. Across the rest of the KC metro area roughly 5 to 7 inches of rain fell, resulting in other numerous water rescues.

Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, the second cluster moved into Furnas County just after 7 pm CST, and it followed an almost identical track to the first. This cluster did not produce nearly as much severe weather. Grand Island experienced severe wind gusts from both clusters - 58 mph with the first, and 74 mph with the second. These gusts were separated by 90 minutes.||These storms initially formed just south of a quasi-stationary front that extended from near Imperial to Omaha.

Late in the afternoon, a few small primarily single-cell low-top thunderstorms began forming over north central Kansas. Around 6 PM CST, two of these storms progressed across the state line and into south central Nebraska. They were joined by a few other storms through 9 PM. These storms produced small (sub-severe) hail in several locations along the Webster-Franklin County border. However, just after 8 PM, severe hail was reported between the towns of Campbell and Riverton. The largest hail observed was the size of half dollars. The tops of these storms were not much higher than 30,000 ft. Between 9 and 11 PM, the coverage of storms increased in an east-west broken line across south central Nebraska, just north of the state line. The result was a transition to multi-cell convective mode. In addition, a small line segment of storms was approaching the western end of this line from northwest Kansas. The east-west oriented line gradually lifted north while the Kansas line segment moved in from the west. Other small storms initiated and/or moved in from Kansas, as a result of the low-level jet, with all of this activity eventually congealing into a mostly sub-severe mesoscale convective system. There was a single report of 1 inch hail in the town of Lexington at midnight. Between midnight and 3:30 AM on the 10th, an embedded line segment of storms became oriented from southwest to northeast along the northern border of Hamilton County and it moved very little. This resulted in a narrow corridor of heavy rainfall between 2.50 and 3.25.||All of this thunderstorm activity formed along and north of a quasi-stationary front near the Nebraska-Kansas border, and ahead of a low pressure system making its way through the Desert Southwest. In the upper-levels, the flow was from the southwest, with a ridge over the Mississippi Valley and a low advancing slowly through Arizona. When the initial storms developed, the environment was characterized by temperatures in the upper 70s with dewpoints in the middle to upper 50s.

A broken line of severe multicell and supercell thunderstorms developed over central Kansas and was gradually lifting north between 3 and 4 PM CST. North central Kansas had been enshrouded by low stratus overcast through the day. So as these storms encountered this less favorable environment, roughly along and north of Interstate 70, the storms terminated their northward movement and began moving east by 5 PM CST. However, a few new storms developed on the northwest fringe of this activity between 4 and 5 PM CST. The first of these storms formed over Ellis County and moved north through the western portion of the County. This storm continued north and crossed into western Rooks County around 5 PM. It produced severe hail over the southwest part of the County, the largest of which was 1.5 inches. The storm then rapidly weakened.||A cold front had crossed the area on the afternoon and evening of the 17th. This front was stationary near the Kansas-Oklahoma border at dawn on the 18th, with low pressure organizing near the Oklahoma Panhandle. Through the day, the front returned north as a warm front, but only the southeast half of the State made it into the warm sector. In the upper-levels, southwest flow was over the Plains. A low was embedded within a longwave trough over the Western U.S., and was making its way from Utah into Colorado. A shortwave trough orbiting the low was ejecting over the Plains. The storm that produced the severe hail was elevated as the temperature at Hayes, Kansas was only 59 degrees just prior to this storm forming, with winds from the east-northeast at 20 kt, gusting to 26 kt.

So as these storms encountered this less favorable environment, roughly along and north of Interstate 70, the storms terminated their northward movement and began moving east by 5 PM CST. However, a few new storms developed on the northwest fringe of this activity between 4 and 5 PM CST. The first of these storms formed over Ellis County and moved north through the western portion of the County. This storm continued north and crossed into western Rooks County around 5 PM.

As the western edge of this rain shield progressed eastward, radar showed a small area of rapidly eroding reflectivity over Mitchell County, especially above 30 dBZ.

The initial line lifting north produced a fairly large area of severe winds from the state line north to Holdrege and Grand Island. A grain bin was removed from its foundation and deposited on Highway 74 near the town of Roseland, in Adams County. A tractor-trailer was blown over on Interstate 80 as well, just south of Grand Island. The highest gust measured was 67 mph at the Holdrege airport. A brief EF-0 landspout tornado was photographed near the town of Exeter. The eastern portion of this line produced the most hail, with a few reports of 1 inch hail over Fillmore, Nuckolls, and Thayer Counties. The bow echo taking shape from Nelson to York snapped a few power poles in eastern Thayer County. The last line of storms to cross the area produced mostly sub-severe winds of 50 to 55 mph. However, severe winds did occur in a couple locations. The highest measured gust was 64 mph in the town of Norman, in eastern Kearney County. A brief EF-1 tornado also occurred in Clay County, just north of the town of Edgar. It was on the ground for approximately 2 miles, damaging outbuildings, trees, and overturning irrigation pivots. This tornado occurred just after midnight CST. Repeated thunderstorm activity resulted in 1 to 2 inches of rain over much of south central Nebraska.

Isolated thunderstorms initiated over northwest Kansas during the late afternoon hours. As additional storms developed, multicell clusters formed. The first cluster crossed into Furnas County around 6 pm CST. Over the following three hours, it continued moving east-northeast just south of Interstate 80. Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, the second cluster moved into Furnas County just after 7 pm CST, and it followed an almost identical track to the first. This cluster did not produce nearly as much severe weather. Grand Island experienced severe wind gusts from both clusters - 58 mph with the first, and 74 mph with the second. These gusts were separated by 90 minutes.||These storms initially formed just south of a quasi-stationary front that extended from near Imperial to Omaha. In the upper-levels, southwest flow was over the Plains with a deep trough was over the West and a ridge over the Mississippi River Valley. There was a subtle shortwave trough moving across the Central Plains. Immediately prior to the thunderstorms moving in, temperatures were in the upper 80s with dewpoints in the middle to upper 50s.

This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north, crossing much of south central Nebraska between 5 and 8 PM CST. As this occurred, another cluster of multicells over north central Kansas merged and moved northeast, eventually taking on the shape of a bow echo. This line of storms affected areas from Nelson and Hebron up to York between 630 and 730 PM CST. More storms over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas eventually consolidated and crossed south central Nebraska as a small scale bow echo between 10 PM and 130 AM CST. The initial line lifting north produced a fairly large area of severe winds from the state line north to Holdrege and Grand Island. A grain bin was removed from its foundation and deposited on Highway 74 near the town of Roseland, in Adams County. A tractor-trailer was blown over on Interstate 80 as well, just south of Grand Island. The highest gust measured was 67 mph at the Holdrege airport. A brief EF-0 landspout tornado was photographed near the town of Exeter. The eastern portion of this line produced the most hail, with a few reports of 1 inch hail over Fillmore, Nuckolls, and Thayer Counties. The bow echo taking shape from Nelson to York snapped a few power poles in eastern Thayer County. The last line of storms to cross the area produced mostly sub-severe winds of 50 to 55 mph. However, severe winds did occur in a couple locations. The highest measured gust was 64 mph in the town of Norman, in eastern Kearney County. A brief EF-1 tornado also occurred in Clay County, just north of the town of Edgar. It was on the ground for approximately 2 miles, damaging outbuildings, trees, and overturning irrigation pivots. This tornado occurred just after midnight CST. Repeated thunderstorm activity resulted in 1 to 2 inches of rain over much of south central Nebraska. There were even a couple reports in excess of 3 inches. Ditches were full of water, and even some minor flooding of low-lying areas occurred near Highway 136 just west of the town of Inavale, and also near the intersections of Highways 81 and 92 west of Osceola.||Low pressure was over South Dakota, and its trailing weak cold front moved into south central Nebraska during the day. It became stationary as low pressure formed over southeast Colorado and deepened to near 990 mb. In the upper-levels, a longwave trough was over the Western U.S. with a ridge over the East. A strong shortwave trough lifted out of the Desert Southwest into the Southern Plains, while a closed low dropped into the Pacific Northwest.

Isolated thunderstorms initiated over northwest Kansas during the late afternoon hours. As additional storms developed, multicell clusters formed. The first cluster crossed into Furnas County around 6 pm CST. Over the following three hours, it continued moving east-northeast just south of Interstate 80. Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, the second cluster moved into Furnas County just after 7 pm CST, and it followed an almost identical track to the first. This cluster did not produce nearly as much severe weather. Grand Island experienced severe wind gusts from both clusters - 58 mph with the first, and 74 mph with the second. These gusts were separated by 90 minutes.||These storms initially formed just south of a quasi-stationary front that extended from near Imperial to Omaha. In the upper-levels, southwest flow was over the Plains with a deep trough was over the West and a ridge over the Mississippi River Valley. There was a subtle shortwave trough moving across the Central Plains. Immediately prior to the thunderstorms moving in, temperatures were in the upper 80s with dewpoints in the middle to upper 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were steep (8 deg C/km), resulting in MLCAPE of 2000-2500 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was between 35 and 40 kt.","Damage was reported approximately 10 miles north of Amherst, where a small outbuilding was knocked over.

Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, the second cluster moved into Furnas County just after 7 pm CST, and it followed an almost identical track to the first. This cluster did not produce nearly as much severe weather.

Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County.

The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281.

Isolated thunderstorms initiated over northwest Kansas during the late afternoon hours. As additional storms developed, multicell clusters formed. The first cluster crossed into Furnas County around 6 pm CST. Over the following three hours, it continued moving east-northeast just south of Interstate 80. Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, the second cluster moved into Furnas County just after 7 pm CST, and it followed an almost identical track to the first. This cluster did not produce nearly as much severe weather. Grand Island experienced severe wind gusts from both clusters - 58 mph with the first, and 74 mph with the second. These gusts were separated by 90 minutes.||These storms initially formed just south of a quasi-stationary front that extended from near Imperial to Omaha. In the upper-levels, southwest flow was over the Plains with a deep trough was over the West and a ridge over the Mississippi River Valley. There was a subtle shortwave trough moving across the Central Plains. Immediately prior to the thunderstorms moving in, temperatures were in the upper 80s with dewpoints in the middle to upper 50s.

Late in the afternoon, a few small primarily single-cell low-top thunderstorms began forming over north central Kansas. Around 6 PM CST, two of these storms progressed across the state line and into south central Nebraska. They were joined by a few other storms through 9 PM. These storms produced small (sub-severe) hail in several locations along the Webster-Franklin County border. However, just after 8 PM, severe hail was reported between the towns of Campbell and Riverton. The largest hail observed was the size of half dollars. The tops of these storms were not much higher than 30,000 ft. Between 9 and 11 PM, the coverage of storms increased in an east-west broken line across south central Nebraska, just north of the state line. The result was a transition to multi-cell convective mode. In addition, a small line segment of storms was approaching the western end of this line from northwest Kansas. The east-west oriented line gradually lifted north while the Kansas line segment moved in from the west. Other small storms initiated and/or moved in from Kansas, as a result of the low-level jet, with all of this activity eventually congealing into a mostly sub-severe mesoscale convective system. There was a single report of 1 inch hail in the town of Lexington at midnight. Between midnight and 3:30 AM on the 10th, an embedded line segment of storms became oriented from southwest to northeast along the northern border of Hamilton County and it moved very little. This resulted in a narrow corridor of heavy rainfall between 2.50 and 3.25.||All of this thunderstorm activity formed along and north of a quasi-stationary front near the Nebraska-Kansas border, and ahead of a low pressure system making its way through the Desert Southwest. In the upper-levels, the flow was from the southwest, with a ridge over the Mississippi Valley and a low advancing slowly through Arizona. When the initial storms developed, the environment was characterized by temperatures in the upper 70s with dewpoints in the middle to upper 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, resulting in MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. As the boundary layer stabilized, MUCAPE remained no greater than 1000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 25 to 30 kts.",,CSV

Isolated thunderstorms initiated over northwest Kansas during the late afternoon hours. As additional storms developed, multicell clusters formed. The first cluster crossed into Furnas County around 6 pm CST. Over the following three hours, it continued moving east-northeast just south of Interstate 80. Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, the second cluster moved into Furnas County just after 7 pm CST, and it followed an almost identical track to the first. This cluster did not produce nearly as much severe weather. Grand Island experienced severe wind gusts from both clusters - 58 mph with the first, and 74 mph with the second. These gusts were separated by 90 minutes.||These storms initially formed just south of a quasi-stationary front that extended from near Imperial to Omaha. In the upper-levels, southwest flow was over the Plains with a deep trough was over the West and a ridge over the Mississippi River Valley. There was a subtle shortwave trough moving across the Central Plains. Immediately prior to the thunderstorms moving in, temperatures were in the upper 80s with dewpoints in the middle to upper 50s.

Law Enforcement reported the tornado just south of the county line near Pawnee Rock and then followed it as it moved to the NE.  The tornado moved through the west side of Pawnee Rock causing sporadic EF1 and isolated EF2 damage to several homes and one school type facility.  The tornado continued to move to the NNE causing EF2 damage to a couple of homes on West Barton County Road.  One residence was a mobile home that lost the far east side of the structure and all roofing material.  One injury was noted at that location as they did not seek shelter.  The home just to the west lost the east half of structure with the occupants seeking refuge in the basement.  Of note, a Ford F-150 was thrown or rolled approximately 75 to hundred yards away from its original location.  Further to the NE, the tornado strengthened considerably as noted by complete destruction of an 1890 farm house.  With the age of the home and no anchoring being present due to the structure resting on cinder blocks along with a lack of debarking, a higher rating could not be justified though the amount of devastation to the structure itself pointed towards a possible higher rating.  Three occupants sought refuge in the basement and were unharmed.  The next door neighbor's home was also considerably damaged with all of the structure being demolished except for one corner section. The tornado then continued to the NE over open country damaging trees and power lines along the way before dissipating NW of Hoisington. A total of 44 parcels were affected. Ten homes were deemed total losses.  The estimated property value losses were estimated at $658,000.",CSV

If any higher amounts occurred, they were the exception. It all began just before sunrise Sunday with scattered showers of light freezing rain and sleet. That was followed by two swaths of light freezing rain that lifted from south to north, through the day and evening, across all of south central Nebraska. Each band was about 50 miles wide. The main, solid band of light to moderate freezing rain, associated with the deformation zone, reached the state line with Kansas by 4 AM CST Monday. This east-west oriented band lifted north, affecting nearly all of south central Nebraska through midday.

In terms of snow totals, counties along and north of Highway 92 bore the brunt of this storm with a fairly widespread coverage of 4-8���, including NWS Cooperative Observer reports of 7.5��� at Greeley, 7��� at Ord, 5.2��� at Arcadia and Loup City, 4.8��� near Shelby and 4.3��� in St. Paul.

Then during the evening, while snow temporarily ended/diminished in northwestern counties, a new area of convectively-enhanced precipitation blossomed in southeastern zones, especially southeast of a Red Cloud-York line. Between 6-10 PM, many places within this area reported brief, intense thunder snow, sleet/graupel or even small hail. Once this evening band of convective precipitation exited eastward, the majority of South Central Nebraska (except for some far northern counties) experienced a multiple-hour lull in snow that lasted well beyond midnight, thanks to the invasion of a mid-level dry slot. Unfortunately though, this dry slot allowed steady freezing drizzle to take ���center stage��� for several hours, slickening roadways across many counties. In places such as Hastings and Grand Island, ice accretion totaled as much as one to two tenths of an inch. As the late-night wore on, freezing drizzle gradually ended from northwest-to-southeast as snow and blowing snow gradually filled back in, driven by northerly winds sustained at generally 20-30 MPH and gusting up to around 40 MPH. By sunrise on Friday the 24th, the main snow band stretched across the heart of South Central Nebraska (including the Tri Cities), while in its wake snow had pretty much ended in northern counties such as Valley/Greeley. Over the course of the morning and early afternoon, this snow band continued sliding southeast through the remainder of South Central Nebraska, resulting in at least brief, near-blizzard conditions with its passage. In central communities such as Hastings and Grand Island, measurable snow largely ended by 11 AM-noon, while it was closer to 2 PM before accumulating flakes vacated far southeast locations such as Hebron. While pockets of blowing snow lingered through late afternoon, conditions improved area-wide by evening as winds gradually diminished. ||In the mid-upper levels, this winter storm was driven by the gradual passage of a broad, large-scale trough axis, with the primary 700-millibar low pressure center tracking from the CO/WY border on the morning of the 23rd, to central Nebraska by evening and reaching central Iowa by mid-day on the 24th. During this same time frame, a strong surface low pressure system with a magnitude of generally 992-996 millibars tracked from southeast Colorado and across the KS/OK border before swinging northeast across Missouri and Illinois, with a tight pressure gradient on its north/northwest side driving the strong north winds across South Central Nebraska. From a temperature perspective, this system brought to a screeching halt a remarkable stretch of well-above normal warmth that had dominated the preceding two weeks.

That was followed by two swaths of light freezing rain that lifted from south to north, through the day and evening. Each band was about 50 miles wide. The main, solid band of light to moderate freezing rain, associated with the deformation zone, lifted north into the region around midnight Sunday night. As the nighttime transitioned into the daytime hours Monday, the band contracted and pivoted, becoming oriented southwest-northeast. It diminished significantly and moved northeast during the afternoon, with the freezing rain ending.||There were probably many traffic accidents that were not reported.

Between 6-10 PM, many places within this area reported brief, intense thunder snow, sleet/graupel or even small hail. Once this evening band of convective precipitation exited eastward, the majority of South Central Nebraska (except for some far northern counties) experienced a multiple-hour lull in snow that lasted well beyond midnight, thanks to the invasion of a mid-level dry slot. Unfortunately though, this dry slot allowed steady freezing drizzle to take ���center stage��� for several hours, slickening roadways across many counties. In places such as Hastings and Grand Island, ice accretion totaled as much as one to two tenths of an inch. As the late-night wore on, freezing drizzle gradually ended from northwest-to-southeast as snow and blowing snow gradually filled back in, driven by northerly winds sustained at generally 20-30 MPH and gusting up to around 40 MPH.

The initial flooding report arrived on the morning of the 3rd, as water along one of the middle channels began spilling into fields near Locust Street a short distance north of Interstate 80, covering the road leading to Camp Augustine. Over the course of the next few days, flooding receded in the Locust St. area, but worsened slightly upstream near the Interstate 80/Highway 281 interchange, where waters inundated fields and reached the parking lot of the hotel just southwest of the Interchange. The situation remained fairly steady-state until sometime late on the 6th or early on the 7th, when water receded and flows returned to normal. ||When examining temperature trends, this multi-day round of ice jamming fit a typically favorable, fluctuating pattern. Leading up to ice jam formation, temperatures from Jan. 28-31 were relatively mild, averaging over 12 degrees above normal. This was followed by an abrupt transition to colder weather Feb. 1-3, with sub-freezing highs and overnight lows averaging 17 degrees, promoting ice formation.

That was followed by two swaths of light freezing rain that lifted from south to north, through the day and evening. Each band was about 50 miles wide. The main, solid band of light to moderate freezing rain, associated with the deformation zone, lifted north into the region around midnight Sunday night. As the nighttime transitioned into the daytime hours Monday, the band contracted and pivoted, becoming oriented southwest-northeast. It diminished significantly and moved northeast during the afternoon, with the freezing rain ending.||There were probably many traffic accidents that were not reported. Numerous relatively short-lived power outages occurred, caused by both ice and falling tree limbs. Some tree limbs were snapped off in spots, with some as large as 8-10 in diameter. Melted precipitation amounts were significant, one to nearly 2 inches of precipitation measured.||At the surface, high pressure was over the Midwest Sunday, and it gradually drifted into New England Monday. The polar front extended from Texas, across the Gulf Coast States into the Carolina's Sunday, and it was quasi-stationary. A weak low pressure system exited New Mexico and moved into Texas, interacting with the pre-existing polar front. This low lifted north across Oklahoma and into Kansas Sunday night where it remained for most of the day Monday. In the upper-levels, split flow was over North America, with the main band of Westerlies along and just north of the Canadian border. Confluent flow was over the Northern Plains and Midwest. A small low tracked across northern Mexico and then lifted northeast into Oklahoma before opening up in the confluent flow.",,CSV

Between 6-10 PM, many places within this area reported brief, intense thunder snow, sleet/graupel or even small hail. Once this evening band of convective precipitation exited eastward, the majority of South Central Nebraska (except for some far northern counties) experienced a multiple-hour lull in snow that lasted well beyond midnight, thanks to the invasion of a mid-level dry slot. Unfortunately though, this dry slot allowed steady freezing drizzle to take ���center stage��� for several hours, slickening roadways across many counties. In places such as Hastings and Grand Island, ice accretion totaled as much as one to two tenths of an inch. As the late-night wore on, freezing drizzle gradually ended from northwest-to-southeast as snow and blowing snow gradually filled back in, driven by northerly winds sustained at generally 20-30 MPH and gusting up to around 40 MPH.

Ice amounts were generally 0.25-0.5, with locally higher amounts. An observer 7 miles north-northeast of Natoma measured 0.75. It all began just well before sunrise Sunday with scattered showers of light freezing rain and sleet. That was followed by two swaths of light freezing rain that lifted from south to north, through the day and evening. Each band was about 50 miles wide. The main, solid band of light to moderate freezing rain, associated with the deformation zone, lifted north into the region around midnight Sunday night. As the nighttime transitioned into the daytime hours Monday, the band contracted and pivoted, becoming oriented southwest-northeast. It diminished significantly and moved northeast during the afternoon, with the freezing rain ending.||There were probably many traffic accidents that were not reported. Numerous relatively short-lived power outages occurred, caused by both ice and falling tree limbs. Some tree limbs were snapped off in spots, with some as large as 8-10 in diameter. Melted precipitation amounts were significant, one to nearly 2 inches of precipitation measured.||At the surface, high pressure was over the Midwest Sunday, and it gradually drifted into New England Monday. The polar front extended from Texas, across the Gulf Coast States into the Carolina's Sunday, and it was quasi-stationary. A weak low pressure system exited New Mexico and moved into Texas, interacting with the pre-existing polar front. This low lifted north across Oklahoma and into Kansas Sunday night where it remained for most of the day Monday. In the upper-levels, split flow was over North America, with the main band of Westerlies along and just north of the Canadian border. Confluent flow was over the Northern Plains and Midwest.

In terms of snow totals, counties along and north of Highway 92 bore the brunt of this storm with a fairly widespread coverage of 4-8���, including NWS Cooperative Observer reports of 7.5��� at Greeley, 7��� at Ord, 5.2��� at Arcadia and Loup City, 4.8��� near Shelby and 4.3��� in St. Paul.

However, despite the fact that the majority of South Central Nebraska did not see truly heavy snow totals, those numbers only tell a part of the this storm���s story, as various areas also experienced one or more of the following:  impactful ice accretion from steady freezing drizzle, at least a few hours of blowing snow and near white-out conditions, thunderstorms producing sleet/graupel and even small hail. ||Breaking down timing/impacts in greater detail, wintry precipitation first got underway on the afternoon of Thursday the 23rd as scattered rain showers gradually mixed with and changed over to snow, initially affecting roughly the northwest half of South Central Nebraska. Then during the evening, while snow temporarily ended/diminished in northwestern counties, a new area of convectively-enhanced precipitation blossomed in southeastern zones, especially southeast of a Red Cloud-York line. Between 6-10 PM, many places within this area reported brief, intense thunder snow, sleet/graupel or even small hail. Once this evening band of convective precipitation exited eastward, the majority of South Central Nebraska (except for some far northern counties) experienced a multiple-hour lull in snow that lasted well beyond midnight, thanks to the invasion of a mid-level dry slot. Unfortunately though, this dry slot allowed steady freezing drizzle to take ���center stage��� for several hours, slickening roadways across many counties. In places such as Hastings and Grand Island, ice accretion totaled as much as one to two tenths of an inch. As the late-night wore on, freezing drizzle gradually ended from northwest-to-southeast as snow and blowing snow gradually filled back in, driven by northerly winds sustained at generally 20-30 MPH and gusting up to around 40 MPH. By sunrise on Friday the 24th, the main snow band stretched across the heart of South Central Nebraska (including the Tri Cities), while in its wake snow had pretty much ended in northern counties such as Valley/Greeley. Over the course of the morning and early afternoon, this snow band continued sliding southeast through the remainder of South Central Nebraska, resulting in at least brief, near-blizzard conditions with its passage. In central communities such as Hastings and Grand Island, measurable snow largely ended by 11 AM-noon, while it was closer to 2 PM before accumulating flakes vacated far southeast locations such as Hebron. While pockets of blowing snow lingered through late afternoon, conditions improved area-wide by evening as winds gradually diminished. ||In the mid-upper levels, this winter storm was driven by the gradual passage of a broad, large-scale trough axis, with the primary 700-millibar low pressure center tracking from the CO/WY border on the morning of the 23rd, to central Nebraska by evening and reaching central Iowa by mid-day on the 24th. During this same time frame, a strong surface low pressure system with a magnitude of generally 992-996 millibars tracked from southeast Colorado and across the KS/OK border before swinging northeast across Missouri and Illinois, with a tight pressure gradient on its north/northwest side driving the strong north winds across South Central Nebraska. From a temperature perspective, this system brought to a screeching halt a remarkable stretch of well-above normal warmth that had dominated the preceding two weeks. In fact, both Grand Island and Hastings notched their warmest two-week February stretch on record between the 10th-23rd, including six days that exceeded 70 degrees.","A snowfall total of 2.0 inches occurred in both Geneva and four miles south of Shickley.

In terms of snow totals, counties along and north of Highway 92 bore the brunt of this storm with a fairly widespread coverage of 4-8���, including NWS Cooperative Observer reports of 7.5��� at Greeley, 7��� at Ord, 5.2��� at Arcadia and Loup City, 4.8��� near Shelby and 4.3��� in St. Paul. Southward from there, lesser totals of generally 2-4��� prevailed along and near the Interstate 80 and Highway 6 corridors, including 4��� near Lexington, 3.6��� at Kearney, 3.3��� at Hastings, 3��� in Holdrege and Minden and 2.9��� in Grand Island. Closer to the Kansas border, snowfall averaged only 1-2���, including 1.7��� at Hebron and 1.5��� at Red Cloud. However, despite the fact that the majority of South Central Nebraska did not see truly heavy snow totals, those numbers only tell a part of the this storm���s story, as various areas also experienced one or more of the following:  impactful ice accretion from steady freezing drizzle, at least a few hours of blowing snow and near white-out conditions, thunderstorms producing sleet/graupel and even small hail. ||Breaking down timing/impacts in greater detail, wintry precipitation first got underway on the afternoon of Thursday the 23rd as scattered rain showers gradually mixed with and changed over to snow, initially affecting roughly the northwest half of South Central Nebraska. Then during the evening, while snow temporarily ended/diminished in northwestern counties, a new area of convectively-enhanced precipitation blossomed in southeastern zones, especially southeast of a Red Cloud-York line. Between 6-10 PM, many places within this area reported brief, intense thunder snow, sleet/graupel or even small hail. Once this evening band of convective precipitation exited eastward, the majority of South Central Nebraska (except for some far northern counties) experienced a multiple-hour lull in snow that lasted well beyond midnight, thanks to the invasion of a mid-level dry slot. Unfortunately though, this dry slot allowed steady freezing drizzle to take ���center stage��� for several hours, slickening roadways across many counties. In places such as Hastings and Grand Island, ice accretion totaled as much as one to two tenths of an inch. As the late-night wore on, freezing drizzle gradually ended from northwest-to-southeast as snow and blowing snow gradually filled back in, driven by northerly winds sustained at generally 20-30 MPH and gusting up to around 40 MPH. By sunrise on Friday the 24th, the main snow band stretched across the heart of South Central Nebraska (including the Tri Cities), while in its wake snow had pretty much ended in northern counties such as Valley/Greeley. Over the course of the morning and early afternoon, this snow band continued sliding southeast through the remainder of South Central Nebraska, resulting in at least brief, near-blizzard conditions with its passage. In central communities such as Hastings and Grand Island, measurable snow largely ended by 11 AM-noon, while it was closer to 2 PM before accumulating flakes vacated far southeast locations such as Hebron. While pockets of blowing snow lingered through late afternoon, conditions improved area-wide by evening as winds gradually diminished. ||In the mid-upper levels, this winter storm was driven by the gradual passage of a broad, large-scale trough axis, with the primary 700-millibar low pressure center tracking from the CO/WY border on the morning of the 23rd, to central Nebraska by evening and reaching central Iowa by mid-day on the 24th. During this same time frame, a strong surface low pressure system with a magnitude of generally 992-996 millibars tracked from southeast Colorado and across the KS/OK border before swinging northeast across Missouri and Illinois, with a tight pressure gradient on its north/northwest side driving the strong north winds across South Central Nebraska. From a temperature perspective, this system brought to a screeching halt a remarkable stretch of well-above normal warmth that had dominated the preceding two weeks. In fact, both Grand Island and Hastings notched their warmest two-week February stretch on record between the 10th-23rd, including six days that exceeded 70 degrees.","Snow came in two bursts and accumulated totals of 2.2 inches at Hubbell and 1.7 inches at Hebron. The first burst of a little snow (along with perhaps some sleet and small hail) occurred on the evening of February 23rd, and the second occurrence was during the morning and early afternoon of February 24th, accompanied by wind gusts to around 40 mph resulting in brief, near-blizzard conditions. There was also perhaps a short interlude of light freezing drizzle.",CSV

This resulted in a break, over south central Nebraska, as the dry slot overtook the area. Meanwhile, a separate small area of snow developed with the compact upper low over northwest Kansas. Snowfall expanded around the northern and western periphery of this low as it lifted into south central Nebraska. A semi-comma-shaped area of snow evolved, affecting areas west and north of Grand Island from the late morning into the mid-afternoon hours. This area of snow lifted north and merged with the larger band to the north, again resulting in another break. While it was snowing, snowfall rates must have been impressive where the 6 to 8 inches fell. The snow bands were very transient and it was almost hard to believe that much snow was measured there. Between 9 pm CST and midnight, a new deformation band of much lighter snow formed from south central Nebraska northeast to Sioux City, Iowa. This band gradually drifted east during the early morning hours, and it exited south central Nebraska by sunrise Wednesday. Very little additional accumulation occurred with this band.||This snow was associated with a 995 mb low pressure system that tracked from Colorado across Kansas Tuesday and into the Great Lakes Wednesday. In the upper-levels, a large trough was over the Western U.S., with a ridge over the East. Several vorticity maxima were embedded in the western trough, and this snowfall was associated with the lead vorticity maximum.",Storm total snowfall amounts ranged from 2-4.,CSV

The vast majority of severe weather concentrated within a narrow, 15 mile wide corridor centered from roughly Elwood-Holdrege-Blue Hill-Fairfield-Milligan. ||Initially, when storms first entered far western counties such as Gosper/Furnas/Phelps, they were in the form of a short-but-intense line segment featuring severe winds, highlighted by a measured 72 MPH gust southwest of Elwood. However, a fairly abrupt transition in storm mode occurred over Phelps and southern Kearney counties, as the wind-producing line segment morphed into more of a supercell structure with a large hail threat. In fact, large hail was the only type of severe weather reported along a roughly 100-mile path from near Holdrege eastward to the edge of the local coverage area near Milligan. Golf ball size stones were reported in or very near communities such as Holdrege, Campbell, Bladen, Blue Hill and Fairfield, with one report of 2-inch diameter hail along the Kearney-Franklin County line. In addition, there were several other reports of quarter to ping pong ball size hail along the way. ||At first glance, this may have seemed like a sneaky severe weather event, as it unfolded behind/to the west of the primary, synoptic scale dryline and instability axis residing from eastern Kansas into Iowa. Because of this, the environment over South Central Nebraska might have seemed less supportive of severe weather compared to areas farther east, especially given surface dewpoints only in the upper 40s-mid 50s F. Nonetheless, multiple factors supported this post frontal severe potential. In the mid-upper levels, a pair of upper level disturbances were traversing the region, including the primary one which entered western Nebraska during the mid-late afternoon. At the surface, forcing/convergence was enhanced by a secondary cold front surging in from the west off the High Plains. Despite modest-at-best low level moisture, cold air aloft and steep lapse rates (evidenced by 500 millibar temperatures of -16 to -18C) resulted in mixed-layer CAPE up to around 1000 J/kg, which proved plenty sufficient for isolated severe storm development given strong effective wind shear of 40-50 knots.",Hail up to 2 inches in diameter was reported along this path.

By the time this snow-maker finally departed the region, it left behind wet, heavy snow accumulation of 4-12 across many western local counties, and some rural areas especially in and near Furnas County endured scattered power outages lasting several days. As just one example of the rare nature of such a significant, late-season snow event, the NWS cooperative observer at Cambridge measured a storm total of 7.3, making this the heaviest snow on record there so late into the spring season (records dating back 118 years). In terms of known measured amounts, (from a combination of NWS and CoCoRaHS observers) the outright-highest featured 12 near Lexington and 10 near Sumner, Arapahoe and Arcadia. During the height of the storm on Sunday the 30th, a portion of Interstate 80 was closed for a time due to near-blizzard conditions. With the very basic facts of this significant event now outlined, the remainder of this narrative will consist of additional details sorted by topic, including: general overview and snowfall specifics, storm total precipitation details, and temperature highlights. ||General overview and synoptic weather setup/snowfall details: A powerful mid-upper low pressure system gradually approached and eventually passed through the Central Plains between Friday, April 28th and Monday, May 1st. For roughly the southeastern two-thirds of the local coverage area (including the Tri Cities), this system was primarily a rain-maker, bringing a much-needed and widespread swath of 2.00-3.50 to most areas, along with a rare, late-season coating of light snow. However, for primarily nine western and northern counties  (especially Furnas/Gosper/Phelps/Dawson/western Buffalo/Sherman/Valley), this storm will go down in history as one of the most significant, late-season snow events on record, as much of this area was blanketed with anywhere from 4-12 of heavy, wet snow during a 24-hour period between the morning of the 30th and the 1st. The combination of this heavy, wet snow building up on power lines and trees, along with northerly winds gusting up to around 50 MPH at times, resulted in several power outages mainly in rural areas, some of which lasted for several days. While some northern and western areas actually received a little snow during the daytime hours on Friday the 28th, by far the main event occurred between the morning of the 30th and the morning of May 1st as the heart of the powerful low pressure system tracked slightly south-through-east of the local area across KS and toward IA and MO. During this time, a roughly 80-mile band of snow fell along a sharply-defined path from western Kansas, northward into north central Nebraska. Within South Central Nebraska, the vast majority of accumulations of 2 or higher focused west of a line from Stamford-Kearney-Spalding, with minimal-to-no snow observed east of this line. While not officially a true blizzard in most areas, near-blizzard conditions were common at times on the 30th as frequent northerly wind gusts of 40-50 MPH combined with the heavy snow to greatly reduce visibility. Because temperatures hovered near-to-slightly above freezing through this entire snow event, some melting continuously occurred. This factor likely played into the fact that official snow totals varied more than usual over short distances, as observers who took measurements during the height of the event reported overall-higher totals than those who waited until the following morning to measure (after some melting had already occurred). While by far the largest amounts focused in western counties, even the lighter totals in central/eastern counties made for some noteworthy climate facts. For example, at Hastings, although only 0.6 officially fell on May 1st, this was nonetheless the largest May snow in 50 years (since 1967).||Storm total precipitation (rain and liquid equivalent snow): Cumulative, 4-day amounts from the 28th-1st tallied 2.00-3.50 across most of South Central Nebraska, with locally higher totals up to 4.73 reported at Wilsonville. Fortunately, much of this precipitation fell in separate rounds and was relatively spread out over these four days, which kept flooding issues to a minimum. For most of the area, this was actually a much-needed significant precipitation event, as parts of especially the southern half of South Central Nebraska had been running a respectable year-to-date precipitation deficit up until this point. ||Temperature highlights: Sunday, April 30th (during which most snow fell) was a record-cold day across most of South Central Nebraska, featuring high temperatures only between 35-40 F.

Locations in Greeley, Logan, Wallace, and Wichita counties had more than 8 inches of snow before the blizzard began on the morning of the 30th.  During the overnight and early morning hours of the 30th north winds increased as a broad area of heavier snowfall moved up from the southeast.  The strongest wind gusts occurred during the overnight and first few hours of the morning on the 30th.  Some of these gusts blew down tree branches up to 9 inches in diameter.  The highest wind gust reported was 64 MPH near Colby.||The widespread blizzard conditions moved northwest through the day, but only extended as far west as Highway 27.  At the height of the storm blizzard conditions extended to roughly 110 miles wide across Northwest Kansas.  The combined effect of wind gusts of 45-64 MPH along with the heavy, wet snow broke thousands of east-west running power poles.  Some residents did not receive power until almost a week after the blizzard.  Conditions were so inhospitable some counties stopped trying to clear roads until the storm ended.  The National Guard in Thomas County had trouble rescuing stranded motorists due to two of their four vehicles being stuck in the snow because of the extreme driving conditions.  Nearly all roads were closed due to zero visibility or drifts across the road.  Snowfall amounts up to almost 30 inches were reported, with some locations receiving as much as three inches of snow per hour.  Within the broad band of heavy snow thundersnow was also reported.  Due to the very warm ground temperatures the snow melted quickly, causing snowfall measurements to be difficult without considering the effects of blowing snow.  If the ground temperatures had been colder, even higher snowfall amounts would have been reported.  Despite the heavy, wet snow eight to ten foot drifts were reported.  The heavy, wet snow caused the wheat to be flattened on the ground in many of the fields.||The corridor of blizzard conditions narrowed to the west through early afternoon then shifted back east.  This caused counties along and east of Highway 83 to have anywhere from one to five hours of a lull before blizzard conditions returned from the west.  The blizzard exited Northwest Kansas by midnight on the 30th.","Snowfall amounts of at least 8 inches were reached on the evening of the 30th, with total snowfall amounts close to 30 inches. The majority of the heavy snow occurred with the blizzard conditions. A federal disaster was declared by President Donald J. Trump.",CSV

For roughly the southeastern two-thirds of the local coverage area (including the Tri Cities), this system was primarily a rain-maker, bringing a much-needed and widespread swath of 2.00-3.50 to most areas, along with a rare, late-season coating of light snow. However, for primarily nine western and northern counties  (especially Furnas/Gosper/Phelps/Dawson/western Buffalo/Sherman/Valley), this storm will go down in history as one of the most significant, late-season snow events on record, as much of this area was blanketed with anywhere from 4-12 of heavy, wet snow during a 24-hour period between the morning of the 30th and the 1st. The combination of this heavy, wet snow building up on power lines and trees, along with northerly winds gusting up to around 50 MPH at times, resulted in several power outages mainly in rural areas, some of which lasted for several days. While some northern and western areas actually received a little snow during the daytime hours on Friday the 28th, by far the main event occurred between the morning of the 30th and the morning of May 1st as the heart of the powerful low pressure system tracked slightly south-through-east of the local area across KS and toward IA and MO. During this time, a roughly 80-mile band of snow fell along a sharply-defined path from western Kansas, northward into north central Nebraska. Within South Central Nebraska, the vast majority of accumulations of 2 or higher focused west of a line from Stamford-Kearney-Spalding, with minimal-to-no snow observed east of this line. While not officially a true blizzard in most areas, near-blizzard conditions were common at times on the 30th as frequent northerly wind gusts of 40-50 MPH combined with the heavy snow to greatly reduce visibility. Because temperatures hovered near-to-slightly above freezing through this entire snow event, some melting continuously occurred. This factor likely played into the fact that official snow totals varied more than usual over short distances, as observers who took measurements during the height of the event reported overall-higher totals than those who waited until the following morning to measure (after some melting had already occurred). While by far the largest amounts focused in western counties, even the lighter totals in central/eastern counties made for some noteworthy climate facts. For example, at Hastings, although only 0.6 officially fell on May 1st, this was nonetheless the largest May snow in 50 years (since 1967).||Storm total precipitation (rain and liquid equivalent snow): Cumulative, 4-day amounts from the 28th-1st tallied 2.00-3.50 across most of South Central Nebraska, with locally higher totals up to 4.73 reported at Wilsonville. Fortunately, much of this precipitation fell in separate rounds and was relatively spread out over these four days, which kept flooding issues to a minimum. For most of the area, this was actually a much-needed significant precipitation event, as parts of especially the southern half of South Central Nebraska had been running a respectable year-to-date precipitation deficit up until this point. ||Temperature highlights: Sunday, April 30th (during which most snow fell) was a record-cold day across most of South Central Nebraska, featuring high temperatures only between 35-40 F.

For most of the area, this was actually a much-needed significant precipitation event, as parts of especially the southern half of South Central Nebraska had been running a respectable year-to-date precipitation deficit up until this point. ||Temperature highlights: Sunday, April 30th (during which most snow fell) was a record-cold day across most of South Central Nebraska, featuring high temperatures only between 35-40 F. However, the very next day (Monday, May 1st), widespread sunshine returned and promoted markedly-warmer highs between the mid-50s and mid-60s, resulting in a faster-than-anticipated snow melt.","Snowfall amounts ranging from 3 to 7 inches fell across the county, with the highest amounts over the western half. Interstate 80 was temporarily closed from Elm Creek in Buffalo County to Overton in Dawson County due to accidents from near-blizzard conditions, with falling snow and wind gusts near 50 MPH resulting in visibility down to one quarter to one half of a mile at times.",CSV

Locations in Greeley, Logan, Wallace, and Wichita counties had more than 8 inches of snow before the blizzard began on the morning of the 30th.  During the overnight and early morning hours of the 30th north winds increased as a broad area of heavier snowfall moved up from the southeast.  The strongest wind gusts occurred during the overnight and first few hours of the morning on the 30th.  Some of these gusts blew down tree branches up to 9 inches in diameter.  The highest wind gust reported was 64 MPH near Colby.||The widespread blizzard conditions moved northwest through the day, but only extended as far west as Highway 27.  At the height of the storm blizzard conditions extended to roughly 110 miles wide across Northwest Kansas.  The combined effect of wind gusts of 45-64 MPH along with the heavy, wet snow broke thousands of east-west running power poles.  Some residents did not receive power until almost a week after the blizzard.  Conditions were so inhospitable some counties stopped trying to clear roads until the storm ended.  The National Guard in Thomas County had trouble rescuing stranded motorists due to two of their four vehicles being stuck in the snow because of the extreme driving conditions.  Nearly all roads were closed due to zero visibility or drifts across the road.

Farther southwest, although severe storms only affected a small portion of northeastern Dawson County, the Eddyville area received off-and-on hail for nearly an hour, some of which was at least quarter size. ||The first one to two hours of storm development took the form of semi-discrete multicell and brief supercell structures. However, especially after 9 p.m. CDT, convection organized into a more concentrated, small-scale mesoscale convective system that gradually lifted north and weakened with time, largely exiting the local coverage area by midnight CDT. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was relatively weak and characterized by broad west-southwest flow. However, this was one of the first high instability setups of the season, as surface dewpoints climbed into the upper 50s/low 60s F range to the south of a loosely-defined warm front draped through the area. At the time severe convection developed, mixed-layer CAPE values were around 2000 J/kg. However, effective deep layer wind shear was relatively modest, only around 30 knots. Once convection formed, it intensified and expanded in coverage due in part to residing within the exit region of a 40-60 knot southerly low level jet evident at 850 millibars.",Quarter to half dollar size hail was reported.,CSV

By the time this snow-maker finally departed the region, it left behind wet, heavy snow accumulation of 4-12 across many western local counties, and some rural areas especially in and near Furnas County endured scattered power outages lasting several days.

With the very basic facts of this significant event now outlined, the remainder of this narrative will consist of additional details sorted by topic, including: general overview and snowfall specifics, storm total precipitation details, and temperature highlights. ||General overview and synoptic weather setup/snowfall details: A powerful mid-upper low pressure system gradually approached and eventually passed through the Central Plains between Friday, April 28th and Monday, May 1st. For roughly the southeastern two-thirds of the local coverage area (including the Tri Cities), this system was primarily a rain-maker, bringing a much-needed and widespread swath of 2.00-3.50 to most areas, along with a rare, late-season coating of light snow. However, for primarily nine western and northern counties  (especially Furnas/Gosper/Phelps/Dawson/western Buffalo/Sherman/Valley), this storm will go down in history as one of the most significant, late-season snow events on record, as much of this area was blanketed with anywhere from 4-12 of heavy, wet snow during a 24-hour period between the morning of the 30th and the 1st. The combination of this heavy, wet snow building up on power lines and trees, along with northerly winds gusting up to around 50 MPH at times, resulted in several power outages mainly in rural areas, some of which lasted for several days. While some northern and western areas actually received a little snow during the daytime hours on Friday the 28th, by far the main event occurred between the morning of the 30th and the morning of May 1st as the heart of the powerful low pressure system tracked slightly south-through-east of the local area across KS and toward IA and MO. During this time, a roughly 80-mile band of snow fell along a sharply-defined path from western Kansas, northward into north central Nebraska. Within South Central Nebraska, the vast majority of accumulations of 2 or higher focused west of a line from Stamford-Kearney-Spalding, with minimal-to-no snow observed east of this line. While not officially a true blizzard in most areas, near-blizzard conditions were common at times on the 30th as frequent northerly wind gusts of 40-50 MPH combined with the heavy snow to greatly reduce visibility. Because temperatures hovered near-to-slightly above freezing through this entire snow event, some melting continuously occurred. This factor likely played into the fact that official snow totals varied more than usual over short distances, as observers who took measurements during the height of the event reported overall-higher totals than those who waited until the following morning to measure (after some melting had already occurred). While by far the largest amounts focused in western counties, even the lighter totals in central/eastern counties made for some noteworthy climate facts. For example, at Hastings, although only 0.6 officially fell on May 1st, this was nonetheless the largest May snow in 50 years (since 1967).||Storm total precipitation (rain and liquid equivalent snow): Cumulative, 4-day amounts from the 28th-1st tallied 2.00-3.50 across most of South Central Nebraska, with locally higher totals up to 4.73 reported at Wilsonville. Fortunately, much of this precipitation fell in separate rounds and was relatively spread out over these four days, which kept flooding issues to a minimum. For most of the area, this was actually a much-needed significant precipitation event, as parts of especially the southern half of South Central Nebraska had been running a respectable year-to-date precipitation deficit up until this point. ||Temperature highlights: Sunday, April 30th (during which most snow fell) was a record-cold day across most of South Central Nebraska, featuring high temperatures only between 35-40 F. However, the very next day (Monday, May 1st), widespread sunshine returned and promoted markedly-warmer highs between the mid-50s and mid-60s, resulting in a faster-than-anticipated snow melt.","Snowfall amounts ranging from 5 to 10 inches fell across the county.

By the time this snow-maker finally departed the region, it left behind wet, heavy snow accumulation of 4-12 across many western local counties, and some rural areas especially in and near Furnas County endured scattered power outages lasting several days. As just one example of the rare nature of such a significant, late-season snow event, the NWS cooperative observer at Cambridge measured a storm total of 7.3, making this the heaviest snow on record there so late into the spring season (records dating back 118 years). In terms of known measured amounts, (from a combination of NWS and CoCoRaHS observers) the outright-highest featured 12 near Lexington and 10 near Sumner, Arapahoe and Arcadia. During the height of the storm on Sunday the 30th, a portion of Interstate 80 was closed for a time due to near-blizzard conditions. With the very basic facts of this significant event now outlined, the remainder of this narrative will consist of additional details sorted by topic, including: general overview and snowfall specifics, storm total precipitation details, and temperature highlights. ||General overview and synoptic weather setup/snowfall details: A powerful mid-upper low pressure system gradually approached and eventually passed through the Central Plains between Friday, April 28th and Monday, May 1st. For roughly the southeastern two-thirds of the local coverage area (including the Tri Cities), this system was primarily a rain-maker, bringing a much-needed and widespread swath of 2.00-3.50 to most areas, along with a rare, late-season coating of light snow. However, for primarily nine western and northern counties  (especially Furnas/Gosper/Phelps/Dawson/western Buffalo/Sherman/Valley), this storm will go down in history as one of the most significant, late-season snow events on record, as much of this area was blanketed with anywhere from 4-12 of heavy, wet snow during a 24-hour period between the morning of the 30th and the 1st. The combination of this heavy, wet snow building up on power lines and trees, along with northerly winds gusting up to around 50 MPH at times, resulted in several power outages mainly in rural areas, some of which lasted for several days. While some northern and western areas actually received a little snow during the daytime hours on Friday the 28th, by far the main event occurred between the morning of the 30th and the morning of May 1st as the heart of the powerful low pressure system tracked slightly south-through-east of the local area across KS and toward IA and MO. During this time, a roughly 80-mile band of snow fell along a sharply-defined path from western Kansas, northward into north central Nebraska. Within South Central Nebraska, the vast majority of accumulations of 2 or higher focused west of a line from Stamford-Kearney-Spalding, with minimal-to-no snow observed east of this line. While not officially a true blizzard in most areas, near-blizzard conditions were common at times on the 30th as frequent northerly wind gusts of 40-50 MPH combined with the heavy snow to greatly reduce visibility. Because temperatures hovered near-to-slightly above freezing through this entire snow event, some melting continuously occurred. This factor likely played into the fact that official snow totals varied more than usual over short distances, as observers who took measurements during the height of the event reported overall-higher totals than those who waited until the following morning to measure (after some melting had already occurred). While by far the largest amounts focused in western counties, even the lighter totals in central/eastern counties made for some noteworthy climate facts. For example, at Hastings, although only 0.6 officially fell on May 1st, this was nonetheless the largest May snow in 50 years (since 1967).||Storm total precipitation (rain and liquid equivalent snow): Cumulative, 4-day amounts from the 28th-1st tallied 2.00-3.50 across most of South Central Nebraska, with locally higher totals up to 4.73 reported at Wilsonville. Fortunately, much of this precipitation fell in separate rounds and was relatively spread out over these four days, which kept flooding issues to a minimum. For most of the area, this was actually a much-needed significant precipitation event, as parts of especially the southern half of South Central Nebraska had been running a respectable year-to-date precipitation deficit up until this point. ||Temperature highlights: Sunday, April 30th (during which most snow fell) was a record-cold day across most of South Central Nebraska, featuring high temperatures only between 35-40 F. However, the very next day (Monday, May 1st), widespread sunshine returned and promoted markedly-warmer highs between the mid-50s and mid-60s, resulting in a faster-than-anticipated snow melt.","The highest total snowfall amounts included 10 inches in Wilsonville, 7.3 inches in Cambridge, and 5.0 inches in Beaver City. Near-blizzard conditions were reported, with falling snow and wind gusts near 50 MPH resulting in visibility down to one quarter to one half of a mile at times. Power outages lingered in some rural areas for several days thereafter.",CSV

During the overnight and early morning hours of the 30th north winds increased as a broad area of heavier snowfall moved up from the southeast.  The strongest wind gusts occurred during the overnight and first few hours of the morning on the 30th.  Some of these gusts blew down tree branches up to 9 inches in diameter.  The highest wind gust reported was 64 MPH near Colby.||The widespread blizzard conditions moved northwest through the day, but only extended as far west as Highway 27.  At the height of the storm blizzard conditions extended to roughly 110 miles wide across Northwest Kansas.  The combined effect of wind gusts of 45-64 MPH along with the heavy, wet snow broke thousands of east-west running power poles.  Some residents did not receive power until almost a week after the blizzard.  Conditions were so inhospitable some counties stopped trying to clear roads until the storm ended.  The National Guard in Thomas County had trouble rescuing stranded motorists due to two of their four vehicles being stuck in the snow because of the extreme driving conditions.  Nearly all roads were closed due to zero visibility or drifts across the road.  Snowfall amounts up to almost 30 inches were reported, with some locations receiving as much as three inches of snow per hour.  Within the broad band of heavy snow thundersnow was also reported.  Due to the very warm ground temperatures the snow melted quickly, causing snowfall measurements to be difficult without considering the effects of blowing snow.  If the ground temperatures had been colder, even higher snowfall amounts would have been reported.  Despite the heavy, wet snow eight to ten foot drifts were reported.  The heavy, wet snow caused the wheat to be flattened on the ground in many of the fields.||The corridor of blizzard conditions narrowed to the west through early afternoon then shifted back east.  This caused counties along and east of Highway 83 to have anywhere from one to five hours of a lull before blizzard conditions returned from the west.  The blizzard exited Northwest Kansas by midnight on the 30th.","Several cars were reported off the road.

By the time this snow-maker finally departed the region, it left behind wet, heavy snow accumulation of 4-12 across many western local counties, and some rural areas especially in and near Furnas County endured scattered power outages lasting several days. As just one example of the rare nature of such a significant, late-season snow event, the NWS cooperative observer at Cambridge measured a storm total of 7.3, making this the heaviest snow on record there so late into the spring season (records dating back 118 years). In terms of known measured amounts, (from a combination of NWS and CoCoRaHS observers) the outright-highest featured 12 near Lexington and 10 near Sumner, Arapahoe and Arcadia. During the height of the storm on Sunday the 30th, a portion of Interstate 80 was closed for a time due to near-blizzard conditions. With the very basic facts of this significant event now outlined, the remainder of this narrative will consist of additional details sorted by topic, including: general overview and snowfall specifics, storm total precipitation details, and temperature highlights. ||General overview and synoptic weather setup/snowfall details: A powerful mid-upper low pressure system gradually approached and eventually passed through the Central Plains between Friday, April 28th and Monday, May 1st. For roughly the southeastern two-thirds of the local coverage area (including the Tri Cities), this system was primarily a rain-maker, bringing a much-needed and widespread swath of 2.00-3.50 to most areas, along with a rare, late-season coating of light snow. However, for primarily nine western and northern counties  (especially Furnas/Gosper/Phelps/Dawson/western Buffalo/Sherman/Valley), this storm will go down in history as one of the most significant, late-season snow events on record, as much of this area was blanketed with anywhere from 4-12 of heavy, wet snow during a 24-hour period between the morning of the 30th and the 1st. The combination of this heavy, wet snow building up on power lines and trees, along with northerly winds gusting up to around 50 MPH at times, resulted in several power outages mainly in rural areas, some of which lasted for several days. While some northern and western areas actually received a little snow during the daytime hours on Friday the 28th, by far the main event occurred between the morning of the 30th and the morning of May 1st as the heart of the powerful low pressure system tracked slightly south-through-east of the local area across KS and toward IA and MO. During this time, a roughly 80-mile band of snow fell along a sharply-defined path from western Kansas, northward into north central Nebraska. Within South Central Nebraska, the vast majority of accumulations of 2 or higher focused west of a line from Stamford-Kearney-Spalding, with minimal-to-no snow observed east of this line. While not officially a true blizzard in most areas, near-blizzard conditions were common at times on the 30th as frequent northerly wind gusts of 40-50 MPH combined with the heavy snow to greatly reduce visibility. Because temperatures hovered near-to-slightly above freezing through this entire snow event, some melting continuously occurred. This factor likely played into the fact that official snow totals varied more than usual over short distances, as observers who took measurements during the height of the event reported overall-higher totals than those who waited until the following morning to measure (after some melting had already occurred). While by far the largest amounts focused in western counties, even the lighter totals in central/eastern counties made for some noteworthy climate facts. For example, at Hastings, although only 0.6 officially fell on May 1st, this was nonetheless the largest May snow in 50 years (since 1967).||Storm total precipitation (rain and liquid equivalent snow): Cumulative, 4-day amounts from the 28th-1st tallied 2.00-3.50 across most of South Central Nebraska, with locally higher totals up to 4.73 reported at Wilsonville. Fortunately, much of this precipitation fell in separate rounds and was relatively spread out over these four days, which kept flooding issues to a minimum.

For roughly the southeastern two-thirds of the local coverage area (including the Tri Cities), this system was primarily a rain-maker, bringing a much-needed and widespread swath of 2.00-3.50 to most areas, along with a rare, late-season coating of light snow. However, for primarily nine western and northern counties  (especially Furnas/Gosper/Phelps/Dawson/western Buffalo/Sherman/Valley), this storm will go down in history as one of the most significant, late-season snow events on record, as much of this area was blanketed with anywhere from 4-12 of heavy, wet snow during a 24-hour period between the morning of the 30th and the 1st. The combination of this heavy, wet snow building up on power lines and trees, along with northerly winds gusting up to around 50 MPH at times, resulted in several power outages mainly in rural areas, some of which lasted for several days. While some northern and western areas actually received a little snow during the daytime hours on Friday the 28th, by far the main event occurred between the morning of the 30th and the morning of May 1st as the heart of the powerful low pressure system tracked slightly south-through-east of the local area across KS and toward IA and MO. During this time, a roughly 80-mile band of snow fell along a sharply-defined path from western Kansas, northward into north central Nebraska. Within South Central Nebraska, the vast majority of accumulations of 2 or higher focused west of a line from Stamford-Kearney-Spalding, with minimal-to-no snow observed east of this line. While not officially a true blizzard in most areas, near-blizzard conditions were common at times on the 30th as frequent northerly wind gusts of 40-50 MPH combined with the heavy snow to greatly reduce visibility. Because temperatures hovered near-to-slightly above freezing through this entire snow event, some melting continuously occurred. This factor likely played into the fact that official snow totals varied more than usual over short distances, as observers who took measurements during the height of the event reported overall-higher totals than those who waited until the following morning to measure (after some melting had already occurred). While by far the largest amounts focused in western counties, even the lighter totals in central/eastern counties made for some noteworthy climate facts. For example, at Hastings, although only 0.6 officially fell on May 1st, this was nonetheless the largest May snow in 50 years (since 1967).||Storm total precipitation (rain and liquid equivalent snow): Cumulative, 4-day amounts from the 28th-1st tallied 2.00-3.50 across most of South Central Nebraska, with locally higher totals up to 4.73 reported at Wilsonville.

Locations in Greeley, Logan, Wallace, and Wichita counties had more than 8 inches of snow before the blizzard began on the morning of the 30th.  During the overnight and early morning hours of the 30th north winds increased as a broad area of heavier snowfall moved up from the southeast.  The strongest wind gusts occurred during the overnight and first few hours of the morning on the 30th.  Some of these gusts blew down tree branches up to 9 inches in diameter.  The highest wind gust reported was 64 MPH near Colby.||The widespread blizzard conditions moved northwest through the day, but only extended as far west as Highway 27.  At the height of the storm blizzard conditions extended to roughly 110 miles wide across Northwest Kansas.  The combined effect of wind gusts of 45-64 MPH along with the heavy, wet snow broke thousands of east-west running power poles.  Some residents did not receive power until almost a week after the blizzard.  Conditions were so inhospitable some counties stopped trying to clear roads until the storm ended.  The National Guard in Thomas County had trouble rescuing stranded motorists due to two of their four vehicles being stuck in the snow because of the extreme driving conditions.  Nearly all roads were closed due to zero visibility or drifts across the road.  Snowfall amounts up to almost 30 inches were reported, with some locations receiving as much as three inches of snow per hour.  Within the broad band of heavy snow thundersnow was also reported.  Due to the very warm ground temperatures the snow melted quickly, causing snowfall measurements to be difficult without considering the effects of blowing snow.  If the ground temperatures had been colder, even higher snowfall amounts would have been reported.  Despite the heavy, wet snow eight to ten foot drifts were reported.  The heavy, wet snow caused the wheat to be flattened on the ground in many of the fields.||The corridor of blizzard conditions narrowed to the west through early afternoon then shifted back east.  This caused counties along and east of Highway 83 to have anywhere from one to five hours of a lull before blizzard conditions returned from the west.  The blizzard exited Northwest Kansas by midnight on the 30th.","Blizzard conditions were reported in the Oakley area, with whiteout conditions reported outside of town.  The very strong winds and heavy, wet snow caused power outages in the county including Oakley.  In Oakley tree branches from two to nine inches in diameter, and one eight inch diameter tree, were blown down from the weight of the snow and the strong winds.  Snowfall reports ranged from 26 inches 6 E of Wallace to 14 inches near the Gove County line. A federal disaster was declared by President Donald J. Trump.",CSV

Some of the heaviest rain hit some of the most vulnerable parts of the city, namely Indian Creek near the Kansas and Missouri state line. in this location between 5 to 7 inches of rain fell over a roughly 3 hour period, causing Indian Creek at State Line Road to rise to 27.96 feet, a new record for that location. The result was businesses in that area becoming inundated with several feet of running water. Numerous car dealerships saw much of their merchandise go underwater at that location. A strip mall consisting of a restaurant among other businesses had water at least 6 feet deep. The restaurant owners tried to salvage their business, but had to flee to the roof in order to escape the rising waters around them. Local news televised a dramatic water rescue of the restaurant owners via motorized raft. Another site that had record flooding as a result of this event was Tomahawk Creek at Roe Avenue in Leawood. Tomahawk Creek crested at 20.81 feet, which was a new record for that location. Numerous city vehicles were damaged or destroyed when a lot near the creek containing those vehicles flooded. Across the rest of the KC metro area roughly 5 to 7 inches of rain fell, resulting in other numerous water rescues.

The strongest wind gusts occurred during the overnight and first few hours of the morning on the 30th.  Some of these gusts blew down tree branches up to 9 inches in diameter.  The highest wind gust reported was 64 MPH near Colby.||The widespread blizzard conditions moved northwest through the day, but only extended as far west as Highway 27.  At the height of the storm blizzard conditions extended to roughly 110 miles wide across Northwest Kansas.  The combined effect of wind gusts of 45-64 MPH along with the heavy, wet snow broke thousands of east-west running power poles.  Some residents did not receive power until almost a week after the blizzard.  Conditions were so inhospitable some counties stopped trying to clear roads until the storm ended.  The National Guard in Thomas County had trouble rescuing stranded motorists due to two of their four vehicles being stuck in the snow because of the extreme driving conditions.  Nearly all roads were closed due to zero visibility or drifts across the road.  Snowfall amounts up to almost 30 inches were reported, with some locations receiving as much as three inches of snow per hour.  Within the broad band of heavy snow thundersnow was also reported.  Due to the very warm ground temperatures the snow melted quickly, causing snowfall measurements to be difficult without considering the effects of blowing snow.  If the ground temperatures had been colder, even higher snowfall amounts would have been reported.  Despite the heavy, wet snow eight to ten foot drifts were reported.  The heavy, wet snow caused the wheat to be flattened on the ground in many of the fields.||The corridor of blizzard conditions narrowed to the west through early afternoon then shifted back east.  This caused counties along and east of Highway 83 to have anywhere from one to five hours of a lull before blizzard conditions returned from the west.  The blizzard exited Northwest Kansas by midnight on the 30th.",Occurred 5 ESE of Gove ahead of the swath of blizzard conditions approaching from the southeast.,CSV

Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas. ||Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties. Although the severe weather threat ended by 11 p.m. CDT, quite a bit of thunderstorm activity redeveloped through the night within various portions of South Central Nebraska. | |In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana. At the surface, early evening storm initiation clearly focused along a composite stationary front/dryline stretched north-south through central Nebraska, attendant to a surface low pressure center that deepened to 998 millibars during the late afternoon hours. To the east of this dryline, afternoon high temperatures well into the 90s F combined with dewpoints in the upper 50s-mid 60s resulted in mixed-layer CAPE values of at least 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of 0-6 kilometer shear increasing to 40-50 knots as the evening progressed.",,CSV

Estimated 75 MPH winds struck primarily southern portions of town around 10 p.m. CDT, causing extensive damage to trees and power lines and ripping a 40-foot section of roof from a lumberyard building, among other damages. Although severe wind was the main story in Superior, hail up to golf ball size also fell. While the immediate Superior area bore the brunt of storm headlines, hail ranging from half dollar to ping pong ball size fell a bit farther west in the Riverton and Inavale areas, with some wind damage also reported near Inavale. ||This storm initially flared up around 7:30 p.m. CDT over northern Harlan County and quickly exhibited severe weather potential per radar data, although no ground-truth reports were received early in its life cycle. Between 8-10 p.m. CDT, it tracked east-southeast through portions of Franklin, Webster and Nuckolls counties, fluctuating in intensity and occasionally showing supercell characteristics. Around 10 p.m. CDT it slammed into Superior, with radar data suggesting evidence of a collapsing core and the resultant surge of damaging winds. Shortly thereafter, it slipped south of the state line into Kansas and weakened below severe thresholds within 30 minutes.||In the mid-upper levels, South Central Nebraska was under a pronounced northwesterly flow regime, situated northeast of a large-scale ridge centered over the Desert Southwest.

This time though, severe activity focused farther south within counties along the Kansas border. Among the limited ground-truth reports: golf ball to slightly larger size hail between Red Cloud and Guide Rock and estimated 60 MPH winds in Nelson that downed a large tree branch. In addition, parts of the area picked up at least 2-3 of rain, especially within southern Nuckolls and southeastern Webster counties, highlighted by 3.54 east of Red Cloud as reported by a CoCoRaHS observer. ||The first storms of the night initiated around sunset just to the south over far northern Kansas, with this activity creeping northward over the state line between 11 p.m. and midnight CDT. Also around midnight CDT, several additional storms ignited along a west-east corridor directly over the far South Central Nebraska counties, peaking in intensity over the next few hours before slipping south into Kansas and/or weakening by 2:30 a.m. CDT. Another round of storms tracked into the area from the southwest closer to sunrise, but these were not severe. ||This was a fairly classic case of nocturnal convection firing up within the well-defined exit region of a 40+ knot low level jet (evident at 850 millibars), and just to the north of a quasi-stationary surface front draped through northern Kansas. In the mid-upper levels, the setup was also typical for summer severe weather, featuring quasi-zonal flow containing a series of embedded, small-scale disturbances.

Also around midnight CDT, several additional storms ignited along a west-east corridor directly over the far South Central Nebraska counties, peaking in intensity over the next few hours before slipping south into Kansas and/or weakening by 2:30 a.m. CDT. Another round of storms tracked into the area from the southwest closer to sunrise, but these were not severe. ||This was a fairly classic case of nocturnal convection firing up within the well-defined exit region of a 40+ knot low level jet (evident at 850 millibars), and just to the north of a quasi-stationary surface front draped through northern Kansas.

Primarily between 6:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, a rash of severe storms consisting of semi-discrete supercells and quasi-linear clusters yielded dozens of large hail and damaging wind reports, including hail to at least tennis ball size in/very near both Grand Island and Hastings. Despite its significance, this was not a tremendously widespread event in terms of areal coverage, as the vast majority of severe weather focused within a relatively narrow, 30-50 mile wide corridor centered roughly through the Red Cloud-Hastings-Grand Island-Aurora-Osceola areas. ||Severe reports were split fairly evenly between hail and damaging winds. Hail was the bigger issue in western portions of the affected areas, with wind damage more of a factor farther east. Focusing first on hail, one of the biggest stories involved both the Grand Island and Hastings areas getting pelted within the same hour. In Grand Island, much of the city saw stones ranging from quarter to tennis ball size. In Hastings, the majority of the city itself observed quarter to golf ball size hail. However, a corridor running from just a few miles southwest-through-west of the city limits endured larger hail up to baseball size. As for damaging winds, the overall-worst impacts focused within counties east of Highway 281. In west-central Polk County, a personal weather station clocked an unofficial gust of 92 MPH, with gusts of at least 70 MPH also reported in the Clay Center, Bradshaw and Guide Rock areas. Many other locations had estimated or measured gusts in the 58-65 MPH range. Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas. ||Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties. Although the severe weather threat ended by 11 p.m. CDT, quite a bit of thunderstorm activity redeveloped through the night within various portions of South Central Nebraska. | |In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana. At the surface, early evening storm initiation clearly focused along a composite stationary front/dryline stretched north-south through central Nebraska, attendant to a surface low pressure center that deepened to 998 millibars during the late afternoon hours. To the east of this dryline, afternoon high temperatures well into the 90s F combined with dewpoints in the upper 50s-mid 60s resulted in mixed-layer CAPE values of at least 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of 0-6 kilometer shear increasing to 40-50 knots as the evening progressed.",,CSV

Meanwhile, a completely separate, isolated storm to the north in Valley County dropped quarter size hail near Fort Hartsuff State Park. ||Timing-wise, the first storms of the day to affect South Central Nebraska developed between 5-7 p.m. CDT, consisting of a smattering of non-severe multicells roaming mainly the far western counties of Dawson, Gosper and Furnas. During the next few hours this activity strengthened somewhat, yielding the aforementioned reports near Edison as it also gradually morphed into a rather compact, east-southeast propagating linear complex. Between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT, this storm complex drifted through mainly Harlan, Franklin and Webster counties before departing into far northern Kansas, likely producing gusty winds and small hail along the way but resulting in no additional severe-criteria reports.

However, factors working against more widespread severe weather ultimately outweighed the more favorable ones. More specifically, the coverage and intensity of severe storms was likely mitigated in part by: 1) rather warm air aloft and resultant capping, as evidenced by 700 millibar temperatures in the 13-16 C range...2) Fairly weak deep layer wind shear only around 30 knots. On the flip side, there was considerable instability to work with, as hot afternoon temperatures in the mid-upper 90s F combined with dewpoints well into the 60s to create mixed layer CAPE of 2000-4000 J/kg.

The majority of local activity targeted Phillips and northwestern Smith counties, as a mix of semi-discrete cells and quasi-linear clusters roamed and redeveloped over the area between 7-10 p.m. CDT. These storms were mainly hail-producers, yielding stones to the size of golf balls in Agra, ping pong balls north of Kensington and quarter size in and near Phillipsburg and Speed. Prior to any development in those areas, a lone severe storm drifting north out of central Kansas into southern Osborne County dropped quarter size hail in Natoma shortly before 6:30 p.m. CDT before weakening. Although damaging winds did not seem to be much of an issue, a KSU mesonet site near Tipton measured a 64 MPH gust shortly after 10 p.m. CDT as outflow surged north out of central Kansas along the leading edge of a weakening storm cluster.

Primarily between 6:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, a rash of severe storms consisting of semi-discrete supercells and quasi-linear clusters yielded dozens of large hail and damaging wind reports, including hail to at least tennis ball size in/very near both Grand Island and Hastings. Despite its significance, this was not a tremendously widespread event in terms of areal coverage, as the vast majority of severe weather focused within a relatively narrow, 30-50 mile wide corridor centered roughly through the Red Cloud-Hastings-Grand Island-Aurora-Osceola areas. ||Severe reports were split fairly evenly between hail and damaging winds. Hail was the bigger issue in western portions of the affected areas, with wind damage more of a factor farther east. Focusing first on hail, one of the biggest stories involved both the Grand Island and Hastings areas getting pelted within the same hour. In Grand Island, much of the city saw stones ranging from quarter to tennis ball size. In Hastings, the majority of the city itself observed quarter to golf ball size hail. However, a corridor running from just a few miles southwest-through-west of the city limits endured larger hail up to baseball size. As for damaging winds, the overall-worst impacts focused within counties east of Highway 281. In west-central Polk County, a personal weather station clocked an unofficial gust of 92 MPH, with gusts of at least 70 MPH also reported in the Clay Center, Bradshaw and Guide Rock areas. Many other locations had estimated or measured gusts in the 58-65 MPH range. Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas. ||Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties.

This time though, severe activity focused farther south within counties along the Kansas border. Among the limited ground-truth reports: golf ball to slightly larger size hail between Red Cloud and Guide Rock and estimated 60 MPH winds in Nelson that downed a large tree branch. In addition, parts of the area picked up at least 2-3 of rain, especially within southern Nuckolls and southeastern Webster counties, highlighted by 3.54 east of Red Cloud as reported by a CoCoRaHS observer. ||The first storms of the night initiated around sunset just to the south over far northern Kansas, with this activity creeping northward over the state line between 11 p.m. and midnight CDT. Also around midnight CDT, several additional storms ignited along a west-east corridor directly over the far South Central Nebraska counties, peaking in intensity over the next few hours before slipping south into Kansas and/or weakening by 2:30 a.m. CDT. Another round of storms tracked into the area from the southwest closer to sunrise, but these were not severe. ||This was a fairly classic case of nocturnal convection firing up within the well-defined exit region of a 40+ knot low level jet (evident at 850 millibars), and just to the north of a quasi-stationary surface front draped through northern Kansas. In the mid-upper levels, the setup was also typical for summer severe weather, featuring quasi-zonal flow containing a series of embedded, small-scale disturbances. As storms peaked in intensity after midnight, the environment featured 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and effective deep layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",A tree branch with a diameter of at least 10 inches fell across the road in Nelson.,CSV

Some of the largest verified stones of 2-inch diameter occurred in/near Geneva and Aurora, with golf ball size hail reported in/near communities such as Genoa, Osceola, Exeter and Gilead. Somewhat surprisingly, there were no confirmed reports of severe-criteria winds locally, despite several instances of wind damage slightly off to the east within eastern Nebraska. ||Breaking down how things unfolded, a few thunderstorms first attempted to develop within primarily the western half of South Central Nebraska between 3-5 p.m. CDT, but they never became severe and soon dissipated. Then, between 6-8 p.m. CDT, a lone strong to severe hail storm initiated over the Grand Island area and tracked east through Hamilton and York counties. During this same time frame, the far western fringes of a west-east oriented severe storm complex entered the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska, dropping hail in and near places such as Genoa, Silver Creek, Osceola and Shelby. Over the course of the following three hours, the western edge of the aforementioned larger storm complex drifted almost due-south through eastern portions of York, Fillmore and Thayer counties while occasionally exhibiting supercell characteristics, before finally departing the local area into Kansas shortly before 11 p.m. CDT. ||In the mid-upper levels, broad west-northwest flow was present over the Central Plains, featuring only subtle, low-amplitude disturbances. However, the combination of instability and shear in the presence of a slowly-southward-moving surface front was quite supportive of severe storm development. As for instability, afternoon high temperatures in the 90s F combined with dewpoints well into the 60s to around 70 in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska yielded considerable mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-4000 J/kg.

Some of the largest verified stones of 2-inch diameter occurred in/near Geneva and Aurora, with golf ball size hail reported in/near communities such as Genoa, Osceola, Exeter and Gilead. Somewhat surprisingly, there were no confirmed reports of severe-criteria winds locally, despite several instances of wind damage slightly off to the east within eastern Nebraska. ||Breaking down how things unfolded, a few thunderstorms first attempted to develop within primarily the western half of South Central Nebraska between 3-5 p.m. CDT, but they never became severe and soon dissipated. Then, between 6-8 p.m. CDT, a lone strong to severe hail storm initiated over the Grand Island area and tracked east through Hamilton and York counties. During this same time frame, the far western fringes of a west-east oriented severe storm complex entered the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska, dropping hail in and near places such as Genoa, Silver Creek, Osceola and Shelby. Over the course of the following three hours, the western edge of the aforementioned larger storm complex drifted almost due-south through eastern portions of York, Fillmore and Thayer counties while occasionally exhibiting supercell characteristics, before finally departing the local area into Kansas shortly before 11 p.m. CDT. ||In the mid-upper levels, broad west-northwest flow was present over the Central Plains, featuring only subtle, low-amplitude disturbances. However, the combination of instability and shear in the presence of a slowly-southward-moving surface front was quite supportive of severe storm development. As for instability, afternoon high temperatures in the 90s F combined with dewpoints well into the 60s to around 70 in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska yielded considerable mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-4000 J/kg. Effective deep layer wind shear was also rather healthy for mid-June, averaging around 50 knots.

The orientation of these storms were such that they trained over Kansas City and surrounding areas for several hours, causing some extreme flash flooding. Some of the heaviest rain hit some of the most vulnerable parts of the city, namely Indian Creek near the Kansas and Missouri state line. in this location between 5 to 7 inches of rain fell over a roughly 3 hour period, causing Indian Creek at State Line Road to rise to 27.96 feet, a new record for that location. The result was businesses in that area becoming inundated with several feet of running water. Numerous car dealerships saw much of their merchandise go underwater at that location. A strip mall consisting of a restaurant among other businesses had water at least 6 feet deep. The restaurant owners tried to salvage their business, but had to flee to the roof in order to escape the rising waters around them. Local news televised a dramatic water rescue of the restaurant owners via motorized raft. Another site that had record flooding as a result of this event was Tomahawk Creek at Roe Avenue in Leawood. Tomahawk Creek crested at 20.81 feet, which was a new record for that location. Numerous city vehicles were damaged or destroyed when a lot near the creek containing those vehicles flooded. Across the rest of the KC metro area roughly 5 to 7 inches of rain fell, resulting in other numerous water rescues.

The vast majority of this activity was sub-severe, producing no more than gusty winds, small hail and locally heavy rainfall. However, at least one storm breached severe limits, with several reports of penny to quarter size hail and 50-60 MPH wind gusts in Kearney around 11 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, while most areas measured no more than 0.50-1.50, Polk County was a wetter exception with widespread 2-3 amounts and even 3.14 in Osceola (this brought the 5-day Osceola total up to a notable 10.19). Although at least minor flooding likely occurred in the county, it was not as significant as the event several days prior. ||While isolated severe storms got underway before sunset just outside of the local area in central Nebraska, it was not until nightfall that activity rapidly initiated and expanded in coverage within South Central Nebraska. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was fairly weak in quasi-zonal flow aloft, although a weak disturbance was noted tracking east across the region. Likely the more significant player in rapid nocturnal convective development was the onset of a 30-40 knot southwesterly low level jet evident at 850 millibars. In addition, the airmass was rather unstable, featuring steep mid-level lapse rates and surface dewpoints well into the 60s to around 70 F. Late evening mesoscale analysis featured 2000-2500 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of effective deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

The vast majority of this activity was sub-severe, producing no more than gusty winds, small hail and locally heavy rainfall. However, at least one storm breached severe limits, with several reports of penny to quarter size hail and 50-60 MPH wind gusts in Kearney around 11 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, while most areas measured no more than 0.50-1.50, Polk County was a wetter exception with widespread 2-3 amounts and even 3.14 in Osceola (this brought the 5-day Osceola total up to a notable 10.19). Although at least minor flooding likely occurred in the county, it was not as significant as the event several days prior. ||While isolated severe storms got underway before sunset just outside of the local area in central Nebraska, it was not until nightfall that activity rapidly initiated and expanded in coverage within South Central Nebraska. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was fairly weak in quasi-zonal flow aloft, although a weak disturbance was noted tracking east across the region. Likely the more significant player in rapid nocturnal convective development was the onset of a 30-40 knot southwesterly low level jet evident at 850 millibars. In addition, the airmass was rather unstable, featuring steep mid-level lapse rates and surface dewpoints well into the 60s to around 70 F. Late evening mesoscale analysis featured 2000-2500 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of effective deep-layer wind shear.","Overnight rainfall totaled 3.14 in Osceola, bringing the 5-day total up to an impressive 10.19.",CSV

Although there were no known, ground-truth reports of wind damage, several automated airport and mesonet sensors recorded wind gusts in the 50-65 MPH range, and even a 67 MPH gust at the Phillipsburg airport. Other severe-criteria gusts included measured 62 MPH in rural northeastern Smith County and estimated 60 MPH east of Phillipsburg. Rainfall-wise, most of the area received a much-needed 0.50-1.50 during the night. ||This organized linear convective system evolved/intensified from weaker convection that flared up hours earlier in the KS/CO/NE border area. In the mid-upper levels, several small-scale disturbances were passing through the region, downstream of a primary trough axis advancing out of the Central Rockies.

Focusing first on the heavy rain and flooding, most areas north of a line from Kearney-Hastings-York measured at least 2-4 per NWS observers/CoCoRaHS/ radar estimation, with localized pockets of 5-7. Some of the overall-heaviest rain targeted the following three areas: 1) Much of Polk County (including a whopping 8.37 a few miles northeast of Osceola and 6.95 in town)...2) Much of Nance County (radar estimates of a widespread 3-5)...3) A roughly 10-mile wide corridor running from the north side of Hastings to around Aurora (widespread 3-5 and up to 6.70 near Phillips). Of particular note, at Osceola the official total of 6.95 set a new all-time 24-hour record for the 122 year-history of the station!||While some of this rain was actually much-needed/appreciated, various flooding issued ensued across several counties, affecting not only numerous rural roads and agricultural areas, but also several creeks and rivers, including: 1) Big Blue River, Clear Creek and Davis Creek in Polk County...2) Lincoln Creek and Beaver Creek in Hamilton and York counties...3) West Fork Big Blue River mainly between northwestern Clay and southern Hamilton counties. Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties. There were only a few ground-truth reports of estimated severe winds, including 60-70 MPH near Loup City during the afternoon and 60 MPH in Cambridge late in the night along an invading squall line. ||Looking closer at timing, a few strong to marginally severe storms actually brushed northern parts of the area during the morning/early afternoon. However, the main event got underway near and north of the Nebraska Highway 92 corridor between 3:30-5:30 p.m. CDT as fairly isolated/intense cells erupted along a northward-shifting warm front/retreating outflow boundary. Over the next several hours, the severity of storms gradually waned, but the coverage of convection and heavy rain greatly increased as a strengthening low level jet interacted with a southward-drifting, west-east oriented outflow boundary. Through midnight CDT, the vast majority of convection focused near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor. Then after midnight, another area of storms pushed in from the west in the form of a northeast-southwest oriented squall line, but this activity was largely sub-severe as it crossed all of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 16th, only an area of lighter stratiform rain remained, before finally departing the eastern fringes of the local area by mid-morning. ||Turning to the meteorological background behind this event, the primary factors were: 1) the presence of a very moist airmass characterized by surface dewpoints between the mid 60s-low 70s F...2) a generally west-oriented surface front stretched near the Interstate 80 corridor...3) A southerly low level jet of 30-40 knots ramping up after dark into the frontal zone. In the mid-upper levels, several small-scale disturbances were passing through the region, downstream of a primary trough axis advancing out of the Central Rockies. Around the time of the most intense afternoon storms, mixed-layer CAPE averaged 2000-3000 J/kg, but deep-layer wind shear held at-or-below 30 knots, fostering slow storm motions and heavy rainfall.","Widespread 3 to 5 inches of rain fell over the area.

Focusing first on the heavy rain and flooding, most areas north of a line from Kearney-Hastings-York measured at least 2-4 per NWS observers/CoCoRaHS/ radar estimation, with localized pockets of 5-7. Some of the overall-heaviest rain targeted the following three areas: 1) Much of Polk County (including a whopping 8.37 a few miles northeast of Osceola and 6.95 in town)...2) Much of Nance County (radar estimates of a widespread 3-5)...3) A roughly 10-mile wide corridor running from the north side of Hastings to around Aurora (widespread 3-5 and up to 6.70 near Phillips). Of particular note, at Osceola the official total of 6.95 set a new all-time 24-hour record for the 122 year-history of the station!||While some of this rain was actually much-needed/appreciated, various flooding issued ensued across several counties, affecting not only numerous rural roads and agricultural areas, but also several creeks and rivers, including: 1) Big Blue River, Clear Creek and Davis Creek in Polk County...2) Lincoln Creek and Beaver Creek in Hamilton and York counties...3) West Fork Big Blue River mainly between northwestern Clay and southern Hamilton counties. Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties. There were only a few ground-truth reports of estimated severe winds, including 60-70 MPH near Loup City during the afternoon and 60 MPH in Cambridge late in the night along an invading squall line. ||Looking closer at timing, a few strong to marginally severe storms actually brushed northern parts of the area during the morning/early afternoon. However, the main event got underway near and north of the Nebraska Highway 92 corridor between 3:30-5:30 p.m. CDT as fairly isolated/intense cells erupted along a northward-shifting warm front/retreating outflow boundary. Over the next several hours, the severity of storms gradually waned, but the coverage of convection and heavy rain greatly increased as a strengthening low level jet interacted with a southward-drifting, west-east oriented outflow boundary. Through midnight CDT, the vast majority of convection focused near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor. Then after midnight, another area of storms pushed in from the west in the form of a northeast-southwest oriented squall line, but this activity was largely sub-severe as it crossed all of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 16th, only an area of lighter stratiform rain remained, before finally departing the eastern fringes of the local area by mid-morning. ||Turning to the meteorological background behind this event, the primary factors were: 1) the presence of a very moist airmass characterized by surface dewpoints between the mid 60s-low 70s F...2) a generally west-oriented surface front stretched near the Interstate 80 corridor...3) A southerly low level jet of 30-40 knots ramping up after dark into the frontal zone. In the mid-upper levels, several small-scale disturbances were passing through the region, downstream of a primary trough axis advancing out of the Central Rockies. Around the time of the most intense afternoon storms, mixed-layer CAPE averaged 2000-3000 J/kg, but deep-layer wind shear held at-or-below 30 knots, fostering slow storm motions and heavy rainfall.","A lot of street flooding occurred in Fullerton. Flash flooding also occurred across Highway 22 between Genoa and Fullerton, near a local seed plant. The flash flooding evolved into an areal flood during the night and lasted until mid-morning Thursday, August 17th. Rainfall amounts in the 3 to 6 inch range were reported.",CSV

Focusing first on the heavy rain and flooding, most areas north of a line from Kearney-Hastings-York measured at least 2-4 per NWS observers/CoCoRaHS/ radar estimation, with localized pockets of 5-7. Some of the overall-heaviest rain targeted the following three areas: 1) Much of Polk County (including a whopping 8.37 a few miles northeast of Osceola and 6.95 in town)...2) Much of Nance County (radar estimates of a widespread 3-5)...3) A roughly 10-mile wide corridor running from the north side of Hastings to around Aurora (widespread 3-5 and up to 6.70 near Phillips). Of particular note, at Osceola the official total of 6.95 set a new all-time 24-hour record for the 122 year-history of the station!||While some of this rain was actually much-needed/appreciated, various flooding issued ensued across several counties, affecting not only numerous rural roads and agricultural areas, but also several creeks and rivers, including: 1) Big Blue River, Clear Creek and Davis Creek in Polk County...2) Lincoln Creek and Beaver Creek in Hamilton and York counties...3) West Fork Big Blue River mainly between northwestern Clay and southern Hamilton counties. Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties. There were only a few ground-truth reports of estimated severe winds, including 60-70 MPH near Loup City during the afternoon and 60 MPH in Cambridge late in the night along an invading squall line. ||Looking closer at timing, a few strong to marginally severe storms actually brushed northern parts of the area during the morning/early afternoon. However, the main event got underway near and north of the Nebraska Highway 92 corridor between 3:30-5:30 p.m. CDT as fairly isolated/intense cells erupted along a northward-shifting warm front/retreating outflow boundary. Over the next several hours, the severity of storms gradually waned, but the coverage of convection and heavy rain greatly increased as a strengthening low level jet interacted with a southward-drifting, west-east oriented outflow boundary. Through midnight CDT, the vast majority of convection focused near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor. Then after midnight, another area of storms pushed in from the west in the form of a northeast-southwest oriented squall line, but this activity was largely sub-severe as it crossed all of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 16th, only an area of lighter stratiform rain remained, before finally departing the eastern fringes of the local area by mid-morning. ||Turning to the meteorological background behind this event, the primary factors were: 1) the presence of a very moist airmass characterized by surface dewpoints between the mid 60s-low 70s F...2) a generally west-oriented surface front stretched near the Interstate 80 corridor...3) A southerly low level jet of 30-40 knots ramping up after dark into the frontal zone.

Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties. There were only a few ground-truth reports of estimated severe winds, including 60-70 MPH near Loup City during the afternoon and 60 MPH in Cambridge late in the night along an invading squall line. ||Looking closer at timing, a few strong to marginally severe storms actually brushed northern parts of the area during the morning/early afternoon. However, the main event got underway near and north of the Nebraska Highway 92 corridor between 3:30-5:30 p.m. CDT as fairly isolated/intense cells erupted along a northward-shifting warm front/retreating outflow boundary. Over the next several hours, the severity of storms gradually waned, but the coverage of convection and heavy rain greatly increased as a strengthening low level jet interacted with a southward-drifting, west-east oriented outflow boundary. Through midnight CDT, the vast majority of convection focused near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor. Then after midnight, another area of storms pushed in from the west in the form of a northeast-southwest oriented squall line, but this activity was largely sub-severe as it crossed all of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 16th, only an area of lighter stratiform rain remained, before finally departing the eastern fringes of the local area by mid-morning. ||Turning to the meteorological background behind this event, the primary factors were: 1) the presence of a very moist airmass characterized by surface dewpoints between the mid 60s-low 70s F...2) a generally west-oriented surface front stretched near the Interstate 80 corridor...3) A southerly low level jet of 30-40 knots ramping up after dark into the frontal zone. In the mid-upper levels, several small-scale disturbances were passing through the region, downstream of a primary trough axis advancing out of the Central Rockies. Around the time of the most intense afternoon storms, mixed-layer CAPE averaged 2000-3000 J/kg, but deep-layer wind shear held at-or-below 30 knots, fostering slow storm motions and heavy rainfall.",A 24-hour precipitation amount of 4.57 inches was recorded at the NWS Hastings Forecast Office.,CSV

Of particular note, at Osceola the official total of 6.95 set a new all-time 24-hour record for the 122 year-history of the station!||While some of this rain was actually much-needed/appreciated, various flooding issued ensued across several counties, affecting not only numerous rural roads and agricultural areas, but also several creeks and rivers, including: 1) Big Blue River, Clear Creek and Davis Creek in Polk County...2) Lincoln Creek and Beaver Creek in Hamilton and York counties...3) West Fork Big Blue River mainly between northwestern Clay and southern Hamilton counties. Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties. There were only a few ground-truth reports of estimated severe winds, including 60-70 MPH near Loup City during the afternoon and 60 MPH in Cambridge late in the night along an invading squall line. ||Looking closer at timing, a few strong to marginally severe storms actually brushed northern parts of the area during the morning/early afternoon. However, the main event got underway near and north of the Nebraska Highway 92 corridor between 3:30-5:30 p.m. CDT as fairly isolated/intense cells erupted along a northward-shifting warm front/retreating outflow boundary. Over the next several hours, the severity of storms gradually waned, but the coverage of convection and heavy rain greatly increased as a strengthening low level jet interacted with a southward-drifting, west-east oriented outflow boundary. Through midnight CDT, the vast majority of convection focused near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor. Then after midnight, another area of storms pushed in from the west in the form of a northeast-southwest oriented squall line, but this activity was largely sub-severe as it crossed all of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 16th, only an area of lighter stratiform rain remained, before finally departing the eastern fringes of the local area by mid-morning. ||Turning to the meteorological background behind this event, the primary factors were: 1) the presence of a very moist airmass characterized by surface dewpoints between the mid 60s-low 70s F...2) a generally west-oriented surface front stretched near the Interstate 80 corridor...3) A southerly low level jet of 30-40 knots ramping up after dark into the frontal zone. In the mid-upper levels, several small-scale disturbances were passing through the region, downstream of a primary trough axis advancing out of the Central Rockies.

Some of the overall-heaviest rain targeted the following three areas: 1) Much of Polk County (including a whopping 8.37 a few miles northeast of Osceola and 6.95 in town)...2) Much of Nance County (radar estimates of a widespread 3-5)...3) A roughly 10-mile wide corridor running from the north side of Hastings to around Aurora (widespread 3-5 and up to 6.70 near Phillips). Of particular note, at Osceola the official total of 6.95 set a new all-time 24-hour record for the 122 year-history of the station!||While some of this rain was actually much-needed/appreciated, various flooding issued ensued across several counties, affecting not only numerous rural roads and agricultural areas, but also several creeks and rivers, including: 1) Big Blue River, Clear Creek and Davis Creek in Polk County...2) Lincoln Creek and Beaver Creek in Hamilton and York counties...3) West Fork Big Blue River mainly between northwestern Clay and southern Hamilton counties. Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties. There were only a few ground-truth reports of estimated severe winds, including 60-70 MPH near Loup City during the afternoon and 60 MPH in Cambridge late in the night along an invading squall line. ||Looking closer at timing, a few strong to marginally severe storms actually brushed northern parts of the area during the morning/early afternoon. However, the main event got underway near and north of the Nebraska Highway 92 corridor between 3:30-5:30 p.m. CDT as fairly isolated/intense cells erupted along a northward-shifting warm front/retreating outflow boundary. Over the next several hours, the severity of storms gradually waned, but the coverage of convection and heavy rain greatly increased as a strengthening low level jet interacted with a southward-drifting, west-east oriented outflow boundary. Through midnight CDT, the vast majority of convection focused near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor. Then after midnight, another area of storms pushed in from the west in the form of a northeast-southwest oriented squall line, but this activity was largely sub-severe as it crossed all of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 16th, only an area of lighter stratiform rain remained, before finally departing the eastern fringes of the local area by mid-morning. ||Turning to the meteorological background behind this event, the primary factors were: 1) the presence of a very moist airmass characterized by surface dewpoints between the mid 60s-low 70s F...2) a generally west-oriented surface front stretched near the Interstate 80 corridor...3) A southerly low level jet of 30-40 knots ramping up after dark into the frontal zone. In the mid-upper levels, several small-scale disturbances were passing through the region, downstream of a primary trough axis advancing out of the Central Rockies. Around the time of the most intense afternoon storms, mixed-layer CAPE averaged 2000-3000 J/kg, but deep-layer wind shear held at-or-below 30 knots, fostering slow storm motions and heavy rainfall.",A 24-hour precipitation amount of 3.03 inches was recorded 1 mile north-northeast of Central City.,CSV

Focusing first on the heavy rain and flooding, most areas north of a line from Kearney-Hastings-York measured at least 2-4 per NWS observers/CoCoRaHS/ radar estimation, with localized pockets of 5-7.

Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail.

Focusing first on the heavy rain and flooding, most areas north of a line from Kearney-Hastings-York measured at least 2-4 per NWS observers/CoCoRaHS/ radar estimation, with localized pockets of 5-7.

Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties.

Some of the worst impacts occurred in and near Ravenna, where estimated gusts to around 85 MPH downed numerous trees, some as large as 4-6 feet in diameter. Portions of the community were without power for several hours, and a few homes and vehicles also sustained damage. In Kearney, while damage was not widespread, three large trees crashed down on a trailer home causing substantial roof damage. Other communities that suffered wind damage (mainly to trees) included: Loup City, Pleasanton, Cairo, Boelus and Grand Island (although impacts were quite minimal on the grounds of the ongoing Nebraska State Fair). Once storms pushed south of the Interstate 80 corridor, most peak gusts checked in around or below 50 MPH, although a mesonet station near Nelson clocked a 60 MPH gust shortly before the strongest part of the complex departed southward into Kansas. As for rainfall, the majority of South Central Nebraska received at least 0.50-1.00, but localized pockets of mainly Valley, Sherman and Howard counties tallied 2+. ||Breaking down event timing and evolution, the late evening featured a smattering of fairly weak storms here and there. However, the main event did not get even get underway until 2-3 a.m. CDT, as the beginning stages of a developing squall line took shape in far northern portions of South Central Nebraska, evolving from earlier activity that initiated in northern Nebraska. Over the next few hours, this linear complex surged south, wreaking the aforementioned wind damage and eventually assuming the form of a mature bow echo before departing into north central Kansas mainly between 5:30-6:30 a.m. CDT. ||Although the severity of this late-night severe event was not well-anticipated, a chance of thunderstorms was in the forecast as the mid-upper levels featured a fairly compact shortwave trough diving out of SD into Nebraska in a north-northwest flow regime. Closer to the surface at 850 millibars, modest south-southwesterly flow resulted in decent low-level moisture convergence into central Nebraska, and at the surface, a weak cold front sagged southward across the state as the night wore on (eventually augmented by storm outflow). Once storms established a surging cold pool, the moisture-rich surface environment proved favorable to fostering severe wind gusts, with dewpoints averaging in the mid-60s to around 70 F. Around the time the damaging wind event ramped up, mesoscale analysis indicated most-unstable CAPE up to around 2000 j/kg and effective deep-layer wind shear around 40 knots.","Wind gusts estimated to be near 70 MPH resulted in tree damage across the area.

Some of the worst impacts occurred in and near Ravenna, where estimated gusts to around 85 MPH downed numerous trees, some as large as 4-6 feet in diameter. Portions of the community were without power for several hours, and a few homes and vehicles also sustained damage. In Kearney, while damage was not widespread, three large trees crashed down on a trailer home causing substantial roof damage. Other communities that suffered wind damage (mainly to trees) included: Loup City, Pleasanton, Cairo, Boelus and Grand Island (although impacts were quite minimal on the grounds of the ongoing Nebraska State Fair). Once storms pushed south of the Interstate 80 corridor, most peak gusts checked in around or below 50 MPH, although a mesonet station near Nelson clocked a 60 MPH gust shortly before the strongest part of the complex departed southward into Kansas. As for rainfall, the majority of South Central Nebraska received at least 0.50-1.00, but localized pockets of mainly Valley, Sherman and Howard counties tallied 2+. ||Breaking down event timing and evolution, the late evening featured a smattering of fairly weak storms here and there.

While there was a lone report of estimated 60 MPH winds at Burr Oak early in the evening, the big story on this night ended up being heavy rainfall and flooding, especially within western portions of the local area. More specifically, a concentrated, southwest-northeast oriented swath of at least 2.50-4.50 drenched northwestern Rooks County, mainly southern and eastern Phillips County, and northwestern Smith County. A 24-hour rain total of 4.95 was reported six miles east of Phillipsburg, most of which fell between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT. During this same time frame, a county deputy encountered around one foot of water flowing over Highway 183 near Glade. When combined with rain from the previous night, the aforementioned station east of Phillipsburg totaled a hefty 48-hour amount of 6.61. Although two-day totals this high were the exception within the area, widespread two-day tallies of at least 3-5 (especially within southern and eastern Phillips County) were common, and this instigated at least minor flooding along several creeks and rivers. At some point between the late evening of the 2nd and Wednesday the 4th, flooding was indicated by automated gauges and/or ground-truth along the following waterways: North Fork Solomon River near Glade (upstream of Kirwin Reservoir), North Fork Solomon River near Portis (upstream of Waconda Lake), South Fork Solomon River near Damar (upstream of Webster Reservoir), Bow Creek in southern Phillips/northern Rooks counties, and Deer Creek and Big Creek in Phillips County. ||Things first got underway between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT as a few semi-discrete storms blossomed in the general vicinity of a near-stationary surface front. Following a brief lull, the primary storm cluster expanded northeastward into the area after 9 p.m. CDT, including the aforementioned corridor of heavy rain that fell mainly before midnight. After midnight CDT, convection diminished in intensity but another line of gradually-weakening storms slowly pushed in from the west, dropping more rain on already-saturated areas before dissipating completely by 6 a.m. CDT on the 3rd. In the mid-upper levels, the setup was much the same as the previous night, as small-scale waves continued ejecting through the Central Plains in enhanced southwesterly flow, emanating from a large-scale trough anchored over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, the cold front which pushed through much of the area the preceding night stalled out and even retreated back to the northwest somewhat during the day and evening, providing an obvious southwest-northeast oriented focus for convection. Low-level moisture was high by October standards across North Central Kansas, with surface dewpoints commonly in the low-mid 60s F. Around the time of peak storm intensity, mesoscale parameters featured around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and rather stout effective deep-layer shear of 50-60 knots. Also like the previous night, storm intensity/organization was augmented by a strong southerly low level jet of 50-60 knots, evident at 850 millibars.","The Phillips County Sheriff reported that one foot of water was flowing over Highway 183 south of Glade where the highway crosses the North Fork of the Solomon River, and this almost caused a deputy to wreck. Storm total precipitation in the area included 4.95 six miles east of Phillipsburg and 3.70 one mile south of Glade.

Starting around 9 a.m. CDT and lasting well into the evening hours, the entire 24-county area was buffeted by sustained north-northwest speeds commonly 30-40 MPH and frequent gusts of 45-55 MPH. Although High Wind Warning criteria gusts of 58+ MPH were not widespread, a few automated airport sensors either breached or flirted with this threshold, including Ord (65 MPH), Hastings (62 MPH) and Grand Island (57 MPH). No precipitation fell in conjunction with these strong winds. ||While there were no notable/known reports of property damage from this event, an interesting agricultural impact was eventually noted. According to several media stories that emerged after harvest, the strong winds on this Thursday were a last straw of sorts for area corn already weakened by other factors such as stalk rot, as many ears were blown to the ground, drastically reducing yields. According to an AP article: The damage varied, but in the hardest hit parts of central Nebraska some farmers reported yields dropping from an estimated 250 bushels an acre before the wind to 190 bushels afterward.||As for the meteorological setup, in the mid levels a potent shortwave trough translated southeastward out of the Dakotas into Minnesota over the course of the day. At the surface, the primary factor for the strong winds were strong pressure rises associated with a tight gradient between low pressure centered over the MN/WI border area, and expansive high pressure centered over eastern MT.",A peak gust of 62 MPH occurred at Hastings Municipal Airport.,CSV

While the bulk of this activity was sub-severe, some of the initial storms yielded a smattering of large hail and damaging wind reports primarily within Dawson and Gosper counties. The most significant ground-truth reports featured estimated 75 MPH winds near Johnson Lake, which downed large tree branches and blew off a portion of a grain bin roof. Otherwise, there were several instances of penny to quarter size hail in that same general area, including in and near communities such as Lexington, Overton and Elm Creek. Well to the southeast of the primary zone of severe activity, a completely separate, isolated storm lifting northeast from Kansas dropped quarter size hail in far southern Webster County near Guide Rock.  Rainfall-wise, the majority of the 24-county area tallied between 0.50-1.50, with one of the isolated higher totals featuring 2.20 southwest of Ravenna. ||Breaking down timing and evolution, the most intense storms of the evening impacted the local area between 7:30-10:00 p.m. CDT. Initially, a cluster of strong-to-severe cells spread into the Dawson/Gosper counties area from the west, yielding the majority of wind/hail reports. With time, this cluster expanded/merged into other activity to its northeast and southwest, forming a nearly solid line of gradually-weakening convection that marched across the majority of South Central Nebraska before departing eastward after midnight. Separate from the main action, an isolated supercell storm drifted across portions of Webster/Nuckolls counties mainly between 8:30-10:00 p.m. CDT before dissipating. However, this long-lived storm had waned in intensity even before reaching far southern Nebraska, after initiating hours earlier in northwest Kansas.  ||In the mid-upper levels, this was a rather favorable early-fall severe weather setup, as small-scale disturbances overspread the Central Plains in enhanced southwesterly flow, rotating around the periphery of a large scale trough anchored over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, afternoon and evening storms first developed west of the local area, focused along both a cold front stretched through western/northern Nebraska and also northeast of low pressure centered over eastern Colorado. Breezy southerly winds ushered in an increasingly moist and unstable airmass, with dewpoints climbing into the upper 50s-low 60s F.

While the initial round of severe convection mainly affected central counties (including the Hastings and Grand Island areas), a secondary round of strong to severe activity raked across west-central and northern counties mainly between 9 p.m. and midnight CDT, dropping half dollar size hail near Lexington and producing a 56 MPH gust at Ord airport. Non-severe storms with mainly just locally-heavy rainfall lingered across portions of the area the remainder of the night, before either departing or dissipated between 5-7 a.m. CDT on the 3rd. ||In the mid-upper levels, the setup was much the same as the previous night, as small-scale waves continued ejecting through the Central Plains in enhanced southwesterly flow, emanating from a large-scale trough anchored over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, the cold front which pushed through much of the area the preceding night stalled out and even retreated back to the northwest somewhat during the day and evening, providing an obvious southwest-northeast oriented focus for convection. Low-level moisture was quite high by October standards across most of South Central Nebraska, with surface dewpoints commonly in the low-mid 60s F. Around the time of peak storm intensity, mesoscale parameters featured around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and rather stout effective deep-layer shear of 50-60 knots. Also like the previous night, storm intensity/organization was augmented by a strong southerly low level jet of 50-60 knots, evident at 850 millibars.",Quarter to golf ball sized hail occurred.,CSV

Scattered multicell thunderstorms began forming early, just after noon CST, north of McCook. Throughout the afternoon, numerous thunderstorms developed over parts of south central Nebraska. Occasionally, an isolated storm briefly developed over Rooks, Phillips, and Smith Counties, but they dissipated or lifted across the state line into Nebraska. However, between 5 and 6 PM CST, cell mergers over Furnas County Nebraska resulted in a short northeast-southwest oriented line segment of storms along the Furnas-Harlan County border. This line moved southeast into northern Phillips County between 6 and 7 PM CST, where winds were estimated near 60 mph north of Phillipsburg. After 7 PM, the line rapidly weakened.||These storms all formed in the warm sector of a deep low pressure system which was over central Canada. Its slow-moving cool front was over the Dakota's and the northern Rockies, while its warm front was east of the region, over Minnesota and Iowa. In the upper-levels, a subtropical high was over Oklahoma and encompassed the middle of the Country. The westerlies extended from the Pacific Northwest to Hudson Bay, with a weak trough over the eastern U.S. As thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower 90s, with dewpoints in the 60s.

Over time, the most potent cells were the newest ones forming on the southwest edge of the expanding rain shield.

As this occurred, and through the evening, more scattered storms continued to form to the west and southwest of the departing rain shield. By 1200 AM CST, the southwest edge of the precipitation area began moving northeast across the rest of south central Nebraska, with the strongest storms eventually becoming focused only on the southwest edge once again.

One of these storms dropped south through eastern Greeley County and was responsible for producing estimated winds of 60 to 70 mph, with downed power lines in one known location. Another storm formed over the southwest part of the County and produced hail the size of half dollars near Scotia. The last severe thunderstorm formed over northern Howard County. This storm propagated due south across the County, producing significant severe hail. Hail up to the size of baseballs was reported in Loup City. One observer indicated that hail lasted around 20 minutes on the north side of town where the largest hail was the size of ping pong balls.||During the early morning hours on the previous day, a weak cool front dropped south across Nebraska with its western edge banked up against the Rockies. A weak low tracked southeast down the stalled portion of the front from Montana, eventually forcing the front eastward as it moved into South Dakota during the morning on this Saturday. As the day progressed, the front and weak low dropped into western and central Nebraska. The flow aloft was moderately amplified with a subtropical high over the Intermountain West and a trough over the Appalachians. Northwest flow was over the Central Plains. Just prior to the storms moving in, temperatures were in the lower 90s with dewpoints in the upper 50s and lower 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, resulting in MLCAPE between 1000 and 1900 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 30 to 35 kts with 0-3 km SRH around 100 m2/s2.",,CSV
