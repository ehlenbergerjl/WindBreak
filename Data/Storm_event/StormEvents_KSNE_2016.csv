Isolated supercells developed over western Nebraska late in the afternoon, with multiple tornadoes, spotty wind damage, and large hail occurring. During the evening hours, cell coverage increased leading to multiple cell mergers. By 9 p.m. CST, this resulted in several lines segments that stretched from Yankton, SD to Broken Bow to McCook. Two small bow echoes tracked through south central Nebraska, from Interstate 80 south to the state line, and another across central Nebraska which affected Valley and Greeley Counties. After 11 p.m. CST, the outflow from extensive thunderstorms over northeast Nebraska sagged to Interstate 80, from York west to Grand Island where it intersected the comma head of the bow echo moving across southern Nebraska. An east-west oriented line of storms developed along Interstate 80. Cell training between 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m. CST resulted in a swath of 2 to 3 inches of rain from eastern Hamilton County across central York County. The highest rainfall amount was 3.08 inches just east of the city of York. These bow echoes produced multiple measured gusts between 50 and 62 mph. Snapped tree limbs and blown over trees were most extensive in the city of Hastings and the towns of Greeley and Spalding.||A very weak cold front sagged into Nebraska the previous night and was located roughly along the southern state line at daybreak. As the day progressed, the front gradually lifted north as a warm front as low pressure over Wyoming deepened to 1000 mb. In the upper levels, the flow was zonal with the Westerlies confined to the northern third of the United States. A subtropical high was over Texas. 500 mb observations suggest there was a weak/subtle shortwave trough moving across the Central Plains, possibly aiding thunderstorm development.

With the glaring exception of the Mitchell County area (which received no more than 3 inches of snow), the majority of the five other local counties accumulated anywhere from 5-12, with the greatest concentration of 10-12 and also true-blizzard conditions focused within Phillips and Smith counties. During the height of the storm during the pre-dawn and daytime hours of the 2nd, sustained winds across most of the area averaged 25-35 MPH with gusts commonly 35-45 MPH, initially out of the northeast but gradually shifting more north-northwest with time.  Given that this storm primarily struck on Feb. 2nd, many will remember it as the Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2016. ||According to several NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest storm totals featured 12.0 at Phillipsburg, 10.5 at Webster Dam, 10.2 at Lebanon, 10.0 in Logan and 9.5 at Burr Oak. In contrast, the Mitchell County area was spared significant storm impacts due the combined factors of slightly warmer air aloft keeping the initial precipitation as rain longer, followed by the fairly quick invasion of a mid-level dry slot nosing up from the south and lingering overhead through most of the event. As a result, official snow totals in Mitchell County ranged from merely 0.5 in Beloit to 3 in Cawker City. In terms of liquid equivalent precipitation, this storm brought beneficial amounts of generally 0.60-1.20 to most of the local area. At places such as Smith Center, the storm total of 0.98 boosted the entire meteorological winter into a top-10 wettest on record. ||Breaking down the timing and meteorological background of this two-day event, the initial bands of a mixed bag of light snow, sleet and rain started sneaking into the area from the southwest during the pre-dawn and daytime hours of the 1st, driven mainly by broad mid-level lift well out ahead of the primary large-scale trough approaching from the Intermountain West. Little to no snow accumulation took place through the day, although by 730 p.m. a spotter in Long Island reported 1-2. During the pre-dawn hours of the 2nd, conditions went downhill fast across most of the area as an organized, large band of moderate to heavy snow lifted across the area from south-to-north, driven by increasing synoptic-scale forcing to the north of a powerful, closed mid-level low churning into southwestern Kansas. At the same time, north-northeast winds continued ramping up in response to surface low pressure deepening to around 994 millibars over central Kansas by daybreak. Across most of the six-county area, the majority of snow had already fallen by sunrise, as most of the steady accumulation during the daytime and evening hours of the 2nd focused north of the state line in Nebraska. However, primarily northern portions of Phillips, Smith and Jewell counties saw at least a few inches of additional snow during the day within the southern end of the deformation zone associated with the nearly vertically-stacked, powerhouse low pressure system as it tracked to the KS/NE/IA/MO border area by sunset. By mid-evening, the vast majority of lingering snow ended as the surface and upper-level storm system departed into Iowa. However, travel remained dicey thanks to northerly winds still gusting 35-40 MPH. Fortunately, winds eased considerably during the overnight hours, and by daybreak on the 3rd speeds were down to 5-15 MPH. ||From a forecast perspective, this event was an overall victory. The initial Winter Storm Watch came out nearly 2.5 days in advance of the worst conditions and the first Blizzard and Winter Storm Warnings were issued nearly 36 hours before the main impacts began. In addition, although the details certainly evolved with time, this was one of those fairly rare instances where computer models correctly latched onto the likelihood for a high-impact winter storm more than a week in advance.","A snow total of 12.0 inches occurred in Phillipsburg, 10.0 inches occurred in Logan, and 7.0 inches occurred at Kirwin Dam.

Little to no snow accumulation took place through the day, although by 730 p.m. a spotter in Long Island reported 1-2. During the pre-dawn hours of the 2nd, conditions went downhill fast across most of the area as an organized, large band of moderate to heavy snow lifted across the area from south-to-north, driven by increasing synoptic-scale forcing to the north of a powerful, closed mid-level low churning into southwestern Kansas. At the same time, north-northeast winds continued ramping up in response to surface low pressure deepening to around 994 millibars over central Kansas by daybreak. Across most of the six-county area, the majority of snow had already fallen by sunrise, as most of the steady accumulation during the daytime and evening hours of the 2nd focused north of the state line in Nebraska. However, primarily northern portions of Phillips, Smith and Jewell counties saw at least a few inches of additional snow during the day within the southern end of the deformation zone associated with the nearly vertically-stacked, powerhouse low pressure system as it tracked to the KS/NE/IA/MO border area by sunset. By mid-evening, the vast majority of lingering snow ended as the surface and upper-level storm system departed into Iowa. However, travel remained dicey thanks to northerly winds still gusting 35-40 MPH.

Central locations such as Grand Island ended up receiving some of the highest snow totals as they spent the most time under enhanced snow bands within the main deformation zone on the backside of the departing low. In contrast, far southeast counties (namely Thayer) saw reduced snow coverage/intensity as a mid-level dry slot nosed up from the south. By mid-evening, the vast majority of accumulating snow had ended as the surface and upper-level storm system departed into Iowa. However, travel remained treacherous thanks to northerly winds still gusting 35-45 MPH. Fortunately, winds eased considerably during the overnight hours, and by daybreak on the 3rd sustained speeds were down to 10-15 MPH in most areas. ||From a forecast perspective, this event was an overall victory. The initial Winter Storm Watch came out nearly three days in advance of the worst conditions and the first Blizzard and Winter Storm Warnings were issued over 36 hours before the main impacts began.

Factoring in the widespread impacts of blizzard/whiteout conditions and drifting snow over such a large area, this was easily the worst winter storm to impact South Central Nebraska in over six years, since the Christmas Blizzard of 2009. Just in Hall County alone, snow removal and other public works related costs tallied over $438,000.

Among numerous other road closures, Interstate 80 was shut down for roughly 24 hours between Lincoln and North Platte. In terms of snow totals alone, this ranked as the second-biggest storm on record for Grand Island (18.3 inches) and was the fourth-largest, two-day storm on record at Hastings (15.7). During the height of the storm during the pre-dawn and daytime hours of the 2nd, sustained winds across most of the area averaged 30-40 MPH with gusts commonly 40-50 MPH, initially out of the northeast but gradually shifting more north-northwest with time. Factoring in the widespread impacts of blizzard/whiteout conditions and drifting snow over such a large area, this was easily the worst winter storm to impact South Central Nebraska in over six years, since the Christmas Blizzard of 2009. Just in Hall County alone, snow removal and other public works related costs tallied over $438,000.

By sunset, several western counties such as Furnas, Gosper and Phelps had already picked up 2-4 of snow, but winds were still fairly light with sustained speeds generally around 15 MPH. By around midnight, additional bands of light to moderate snow had boosted totals as high as 7 in far southwestern locations such as Cambridge, but most of South Central Nebraska had 2 or less. During the pre-dawn hours of the 2nd, conditions went downhill fast as an organized, large band of moderate to heavy snow lifted across the area from south-to-north, driven by increasing synoptic-scale forcing to the north of a powerful, closed mid-level low churning into southwestern Kansas.

Among numerous other road closures, Interstate 80 was shut down for roughly 24 hours between Lincoln and North Platte. In terms of snow totals alone, this ranked as the second-biggest storm on record for Grand Island (18.3 inches) and was the fourth-largest, two-day storm on record at Hastings (15.7). During the height of the storm during the pre-dawn and daytime hours of the 2nd, sustained winds across most of the area averaged 30-40 MPH with gusts commonly 40-50 MPH, initially out of the northeast but gradually shifting more north-northwest with time. Factoring in the widespread impacts of blizzard/whiteout conditions and drifting snow over such a large area, this was easily the worst winter storm to impact South Central Nebraska in over six years, since the Christmas Blizzard of 2009. Just in Hall County alone, snow removal and other public works related costs tallied over $438,000. Given that this storm primarily struck on Feb. 2nd, many will remember it as the Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2016. ||According to dozens of NWS cooperative observers, the majority of the 24-county area accumulated snow totals between 10-16, with a few of the highest official amounts featuring 18.3 at Grand Island, 18.0 at Wilsonville and 16.5 at Holdrege. Only the extreme southeast corner of the local area was spared the worst conditions, as much of Fillmore and especially Thayer counties only saw 5-8 inches. Also in the Thayer County area, winds were not quite as intense through most of the event, with less in the way of true-blizzard conditions. In terms of liquid equivalent precipitation, this storm helped propel many locations to a top-10 wettest meteorological winter on record thanks to liquid totals ranging from 0.70-1.60 in most places, and as high as 1.81 in Grand Island. ||Breaking down the timing and meteorological background of this two-day event, the initial bands of generally light snow started sneaking into the area from the southwest during the pre-dawn and daytime hours of the 1st, driven mainly by broad mid-level lift well out ahead of the primary large-scale trough approaching from the Intermountain West. By sunset, several western counties such as Furnas, Gosper and Phelps had already picked up 2-4 of snow, but winds were still fairly light with sustained speeds generally around 15 MPH. By around midnight, additional bands of light to moderate snow had boosted totals as high as 7 in far southwestern locations such as Cambridge, but most of South Central Nebraska had 2 or less. During the pre-dawn hours of the 2nd, conditions went downhill fast as an organized, large band of moderate to heavy snow lifted across the area from south-to-north, driven by increasing synoptic-scale forcing to the north of a powerful, closed mid-level low churning into southwestern Kansas. At the same time, northeast winds ramped up considerably in response to surface low pressure deepening to around 994 millibars over central Kansas by daybreak. By 6-7 a.m., full-blown blizzard conditions were solidly in place across most of the local area, with 11.8 of snow reported at Cambridge, 10 at Holdrege and 6 at places such as Grand Island, Hastings and Osceola. During the day, blizzard conditions raged on across most of the area as the nearly vertically-stacked, powerhouse low pressure system tracked to the NE/KS/IA/MO border area by sunset. Central locations such as Grand Island ended up receiving some of the highest snow totals as they spent the most time under enhanced snow bands within the main deformation zone on the backside of the departing low. In contrast, far southeast counties (namely Thayer) saw reduced snow coverage/intensity as a mid-level dry slot nosed up from the south. By mid-evening, the vast majority of accumulating snow had ended as the surface and upper-level storm system departed into Iowa. However, travel remained treacherous thanks to northerly winds still gusting 35-45 MPH. Fortunately, winds eased considerably during the overnight hours, and by daybreak on the 3rd sustained speeds were down to 10-15 MPH in most areas. ||From a forecast perspective, this event was an overall victory. The initial Winter Storm Watch came out nearly three days in advance of the worst conditions and the first Blizzard and Winter Storm Warnings were issued over 36 hours before the main impacts began. In addition, although the details certainly evolved with time, this was one of those fairly rare instances when computer models correctly latched onto the likelihood for a high-impact winter storm more than a week in advance.",A snow total of 12.0 inches occurred in Superior. The combination of this snow and frequent wind gusts over 40 mph caused visibility to be one quarter mile or less.,CSV

As the strong storm moved into the Plains during the morning hours on the 23rd, Gulf moisture rushed northward ahead of the system and allowed for thunderstorms and isolated severe weather to occur during the afternoon on the 23rd. On the back side of the system though, colder air fed in from the northern Plains and allowed for the rain to mix with and change over to snow over northeast Nebraska and extreme west central Iowa during the late afternoon and especially during the evening. Heavy snow was then observed in a band from northwest Iowa into northeast Nebraska with some thundersnow also observed. Extremely heavy snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches an hour occurred within this band leading to many snowfall totals over 1 foot in a relatively short amount of time. The storm system finally started to shift out of the area during the early morning hours on the 24th.",Emergency management reported that strong gradient winds ahead of the cold front caused some outbuilding damage across Richardson County. This was most prevalent near the town of Preston and along the Kansas and Nebraska border along 702 Rd.,CSV

Evolution of precipitation associated with this system was complex.

This band was north of the polar front and its western fringe wrapped cyclonically around the northern and western periphery of a developing upper-level low. This system entrained significant dry air in the mid-upper levels. So, precipitation in the warm sector was initially non-existent. It wasn't until mid-late afternoon that a comma-shaped band of scattered showers and a few embedded thunderstorms developed within and in the eastern semi-circle of the vorticity maximum over Kansas and Nebraska. Around 4 p.m., a storm over northern Hamilton county produced half inch hail near Hordville. This storm occurred on the cool side of the front, with temperatures in the middle 30s. The initial band of showers and storms quickly exited south central Nebraska by late afternoon. The small area of lingering rain in the center of the upper-level low (primarily over Buffalo, Hall, Kearney, Adams, Franklin, and Webster counties) changed to snow by early evening, and thunder was associated with it. Two to 5 inches of snow fell in these areas.

Evolution of precipitation associated with this system was complex. Through the morning hours, a long, skinny band of frontogenetic/WAA precipitation formed and was oriented west-east from the Great Lakes westward across Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, then southwest across the Nebraska panhandle into eastern Colorado. This band was north of the polar front and its western fringe wrapped cyclonically around the northern and western periphery of a developing upper-level low. This system entrained significant dry air in the mid-upper levels. So, precipitation in the warm sector was initially non-existent. It wasn't until mid-late afternoon that a comma-shaped band of scattered showers and a few embedded thunderstorms developed within and in the eastern semi-circle of the vorticity maximum over Kansas and Nebraska. Around 4 p.m., a storm over northern Hamilton county produced half inch hail near Hordville. This storm occurred on the cool side of the front, with temperatures in the middle 30s. The initial band of showers and storms quickly exited south central Nebraska by late afternoon. The small area of lingering rain in the center of the upper-level low (primarily over Buffalo, Hall, Kearney, Adams, Franklin, and Webster counties) changed to snow by early evening, and thunder was associated with it. Two to 5 inches of snow fell in these areas. As the low moved to the east during the night, the deformation band north and west of the low finally moved into and across south central Nebraska with a gradually diminishing trend. The band remained very skinny. Some of the initial showers that developed in the afternoon rotated to the northwest across Greeley and Valley counties, merging with the deformation band over the Sandhills. This, combined with the band moving through during the night, resulted in snowfall persisting along enough for a small area of 4 to 5 inches of accumulation over much these counties. There were a couple spots that received as much as 8 inches, including Ord. This was the highest amount associated with this storm. Across the rest of south central Nebraska, snowfall amounts were under 2 inches. There was a lot of wind with this system. Northeast winds were sustained between 30 and 40 mph for much of the day, with widespread gusts generally between 45 and 55 mph. There were a couple locations that had higher gusts, with 61 mph recorded at Evelyn Sharp Airport in Ord. These windy conditions did result in some wind damage in a couple locations, with a metal roof blown off a saloon in Giltner and a tree that fell onto a house in Arcadia.||A polar cold front dropped into Nebraska on Tuesday the 22nd and became stationary across northern Kansas on the 23rd. Lee cyclogenesis occurred over Colorado, with a strong 990 mb surface low heading east-northeast along the front. By 9 p.m., this low was over the Kansas City area. It continued advancing through northern Missouri during the night. In the upper levels, split flow was over North America. A moderate amplitude shortwave trough was advancing through the western U.S., with a broad ridge in the East. Confluent flow extended from the Northern Plains into the Great Lakes. As cyclogenesis occurred, a closed mid-level low formed briefly over Nebraska and Kansas, before opening back up into a trough by daybreak on the 24th.","Snowfall totals generally ranged from 1 to 3 inches, with the highest totals being across far west-northwestern portions of the county. Wind gusts at times were near 50 MPH, resulting in periods of reduced visibility. The AWOS at the Aurora Airport reported a peak gust of 53 MPH.

However, of these two days, Thursday the 7th took top prize, featuring several hours of sustained speeds generally 30-45 MPH and a handful of severe-criteria gusts to around 60 MPH as measured by mesonet stations. Although the entire late-morning through late-afternoon was quite windy, most of the peak gusts occurred between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. CDT, with the highest-known speed of 62 MPH occurring near Red Cloud. Damage reports were few, but a semi-truck was toppled on Highway 6 just east of Holdrege. At primary automated airport stations within the area, peak gusts included 55 MPH at Grand Island and Ord, and 53 MPH at Hastings. In some places, blowing dust resulted in mainly minor visibility reductions. Winds eased considerably by sunset, to under 10 MPH by 9 p.m. CDT. ||Judging by the surface weather map, this was a somewhat unusual high wind event for the local area, as the west-to-east pressure gradient across Nebraska was only around 10 millibars at most. However, very deep mixing (up to around 700 millibars) into strong, unidirectional flow aloft, along with efficient downward-momentum transfer on the backside of a shortwave trough diving southeast through the Missouri Valley proved plenty sufficient. On the larger scale of the mid-upper levels, Nebraska resided squarely under the core of intense northwesterly flow within the interface between a sprawling trough centered over the Great Lakes and a highly amplified ridge over the western United States.",A 60 mph non-thunderstorm wind gust was measured by a mesonet located 9 miles northwest of Red Cloud.,CSV

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of central/eastern Kansas under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail in parts of central and eastern Kansas, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",Nickel size hail was reported at the junction of Highway 36 and Highway 14.,CSV

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas. Except for the far southeastern edges around Thayer County, nearly all of South Central Nebraska remained slightly north of the quasi-stationary front/warm front throughout the late afternoon/evening hours. As a result, late afternoon surface temperatures only averaged in the upper 60s-lower 70s F, dewpoints only in the 50s and breezes were steady from the east-northeast. Despite residing north of the main frontal zone, mesoscale parameters were still supportive of severe storms as far north as the Interstate 80 corridor, featuring as much as 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas. Except for the far southeastern edges around Thayer County, nearly all of South Central Nebraska remained slightly north of the quasi-stationary front/warm front throughout the late afternoon/evening hours. As a result, late afternoon surface temperatures only averaged in the upper 60s-lower 70s F, dewpoints only in the 50s and breezes were steady from the east-northeast. Despite residing north of the main frontal zone, mesoscale parameters were still supportive of severe storms as far north as the Interstate 80 corridor, featuring as much as 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek.

As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas. Except for the far southeastern edges around Thayer County, nearly all of South Central Nebraska remained slightly north of the quasi-stationary front/warm front throughout the late afternoon/evening hours. As a result, late afternoon surface temperatures only averaged in the upper 60s-lower 70s F, dewpoints only in the 50s and breezes were steady from the east-northeast. Despite residing north of the main frontal zone, mesoscale parameters were still supportive of severe storms as far north as the Interstate 80 corridor, featuring as much as 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of South Central Nebraska and points southward under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail within the local area, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",Wind gusts were estimated to be near 60 MPH.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas. Except for the far southeastern edges around Thayer County, nearly all of South Central Nebraska remained slightly north of the quasi-stationary front/warm front throughout the late afternoon/evening hours. As a result, late afternoon surface temperatures only averaged in the upper 60s-lower 70s F, dewpoints only in the 50s and breezes were steady from the east-northeast. Despite residing north of the main frontal zone, mesoscale parameters were still supportive of severe storms as far north as the Interstate 80 corridor, featuring as much as 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of South Central Nebraska and points southward under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail within the local area, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",Twenty-four rainfall was 5.10 inches.,CSV

Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas. Except for the far southeastern edges around Thayer County, nearly all of South Central Nebraska remained slightly north of the quasi-stationary front/warm front throughout the late afternoon/evening hours. As a result, late afternoon surface temperatures only averaged in the upper 60s-lower 70s F, dewpoints only in the 50s and breezes were steady from the east-northeast. Despite residing north of the main frontal zone, mesoscale parameters were still supportive of severe storms as far north as the Interstate 80 corridor, featuring as much as 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of South Central Nebraska and points southward under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail within the local area, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",Twenty-four rainfall was 3.09 inches.,CSV

These hail-producers consisted of a cluster of four separate supercell storms, all within close proximity to one another. The largest reported hail up to golf ball size fell five miles east of Jewell. A short time later, a separate storm dumped hail on Formoso for 20-straight minutes, the largest of which was ping pong ball size (most was smaller). A third storm likely also produced large hail in northeastern parts of the county (despite a lack of reports from within the county itself), as evidenced by golf ball size stones reported in nearby Superior, Nebraska. Radar indicated that a fourth severe storm likely affected west-central Mitchell County, but there were also no verifying ground truth reports. While hail was the main story in Jewell County, it was narrowly spared a tornado threat, as separate tornadoes touched down in bordering Nuckolls and Republic counties.

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments.

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of central/eastern Kansas under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail in parts of central and eastern Kansas, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",,CSV

As for hail, ground-truth reports were fairly limited, but a separate storm (not the same one that produced the tornado) dropped ping pong ball to golf ball stones from Superior to at least three miles east of Superior. Earlier on, the initial severe storm development of the afternoon yielded ping pong ball size hail south of Red Cloud. ||Within the local South Central Nebraska area, this event consisted of a fairly localized cluster of multicell and a few supercell storms, the majority of which affected Nuckolls, Webster Thayer and Fillmore counties between 5:00-7:30 p.m. CDT before exiting into southeast Nebraska.

At mid-afternoon, the primary surface low of around 996 millibars was centered in central South Dakota, while a secondary, slightly weaker low developed in west central Kansas.

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler.

Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas. Except for the far southeastern edges around Thayer County, nearly all of South Central Nebraska remained slightly north of the quasi-stationary front/warm front throughout the late afternoon/evening hours. As a result, late afternoon surface temperatures only averaged in the upper 60s-lower 70s F, dewpoints only in the 50s and breezes were steady from the east-northeast. Despite residing north of the main frontal zone, mesoscale parameters were still supportive of severe storms as far north as the Interstate 80 corridor, featuring as much as 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of South Central Nebraska and points southward under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail within the local area, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",,CSV

The majority of severe storms concentrated within the southeast quadrant of the area (especially Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties), although a secondary zone of severe weather and heavy rainfall also flared up in western counties such as Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo. Most severe weather reports consisted of hail, the largest of which was up to tennis ball size in Deshler. Fortunately, a possible tornado threat did not materialize (more on that below). There were actually two separate episodes of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours (in far southeast counties) and then the main show during the late afternoon/evening. ||In terms of highest impacts, the story of the day ended up being flash flooding in eastern Nuckolls and western Thayer counties, especially in and near Deshler. Mainly between 5-8 p.m. CDT, a nearly continuous axis of strong to severe storms streamed within roughly five miles either side of the Nuckolls/Thayer County line, dumping at least 4-6 of rain. Around 7:45 p.m. CDT, a storm chaser three miles west of Deshler posted fairly dramatic video showing a roughly 200-yard stretch of Highway 136 inundated by up to 4 feet of rushing water. Given that this deluge fell directly over the Spring and Snake Creek basins just upstream of Deshler, it did not take long for flash flooding to reach the community. By 9 p.m. CDT, evacuations were underway at nursing home and assisted living facilities, and one man had to be rescued when he became surrounded by rising water while boarding up his home. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural roads in the Ruskin and Deshler areas remained water-covered for several hours. Fortunately, actual infrastructure damage was limited, and most roads re-opened the next day. Officially, the highest measured 24-hour total was 5.10 in Ruskin (NeRAIN observer), but radar estimation suggested that areas between Ruskin and Deshler likely received 6+ inches. This was the second-consecutive year that Deshler dealt with notable flooding (it also occurred May 6, 2015). Although not as serious overall, a secondary area of flooding materialized in western portions of South Central Nebraska, mainly within a narrow corridor extending from western Buffalo County southward through Phelps and northern Harlan counties, where 24-hour rain totals averaged 2-4, including 3.62 at the Holdrege airport. Most of this rain fell between 7-10 p.m. CDT. Within this zone, some roads were also impacted by flooding, including in the Elm Creek, Atlanta and Holdrege areas. While most water issues here also improved by the following day, flooding persisted through Thursday the 28th along the Turkey Creek in southern Buffalo County. ||Focusing on non-flooding aspects of this severe weather event, the initial round of early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that affected mainly Thayer, Nuckolls and Fillmore counties between 3:00-6:30 a.m. CDT, with stones to at least quarter size reported in Hebron, Hardy and near Carleton. After this early morning activity exited to the east around sunrise, most of the day featured a solid lull before afternoon/evening redevelopment. Round 1 of the main event occurred primarily between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, as a number of multicell to transient supercell storm clusters roamed Nuckolls, Thayer and Clay counties, and brushing as far north as Hamilton County. Within this zone, hail reports featured up to tennis ball size in Deshler, golf ball size near Superior and Hardy, and half dollar size in Fairfield. One storm southwest of Deshler briefly exhibited tornadic potential but no touchdowns were reported. As round 1 started to weaken in eastern counties, an entirely separate round 2 of severe storms rapidly fired up to the west within Harlan, Phelps, eastern Dawson and western Buffalo counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Although the aforementioned heavy rain situation was the main impact of these western storms, quarter size hail also fell in or near Atlanta, Ragan and Elm Creek. By mid-to-late evening, all storms within South Central Nebraska subsided to below severe limits, but areas of weaker convection persisted through the night. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned slightly north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched west-to-east across northern Kansas, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE up to 2000 J/kg.  By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was centered over central Kansas. Except for the far southeastern edges around Thayer County, nearly all of South Central Nebraska remained slightly north of the quasi-stationary front/warm front throughout the late afternoon/evening hours. As a result, late afternoon surface temperatures only averaged in the upper 60s-lower 70s F, dewpoints only in the 50s and breezes were steady from the east-northeast. Despite residing north of the main frontal zone, mesoscale parameters were still supportive of severe storms as far north as the Interstate 80 corridor, featuring as much as 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of South Central Nebraska and points southward under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail within the local area, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.","Flash flooding struck western Thayer and eastern Nuckolls County on this Tuesday evening/night, thanks to a fairly narrow, north-south oriented swath of at least 4-6 inches of rain. The greatest flooding impacts occurred in the community of Deshler, as both the Spring Creek and Snake Creek flooded, along with general street flooding. The fire chief evacuated approximately 45 residents from a local nursing and assisted living home. A few residents on the south side of town on 4th Street were also evacuated. A person was trapped south of Snake Creek Bridge on 4th Street, due to the quickly rising water. Flooding also closed Highway 136 between Deshler and Ruskin for several hours, as storm chaser video depicted a roughly 200-yard stretch of water rushing across the highway three miles west of Deshler around 7:45 p.m. CDT. In addition to Highway 136, a number of rural county roads were covered with water due to flooding from nearby Spring Creek. Although general flooding of mainly low-lying areas persisted into the day of Wednesday the 27th, the worst of the more serious flash flooding eased during the pre-dawn hours.",CSV

The EF1-rated tornado was the story of the day locally, as it traced nearly a three mile, curved path from approximately eight miles to five miles northwest of Superior shortly after 6 p.m. CDT. Along the way, it damaged trees, fence line and power poles. It was also highly visible (some folks saw it from nearly 20 miles away) and was even captured live by a TV station webcam in Superior. Nearly an hour later, another tornado narrowly missed southern Thayer County, but remained slightly south of the state line in Republic County Kansas. As for hail, ground-truth reports were fairly limited, but a separate storm (not the same one that produced the tornado) dropped ping pong ball to golf ball stones from Superior to at least three miles east of Superior. Earlier on, the initial severe storm development of the afternoon yielded ping pong ball size hail south of Red Cloud. ||Within the local South Central Nebraska area, this event consisted of a fairly localized cluster of multicell and a few supercell storms, the majority of which affected Nuckolls, Webster Thayer and Fillmore counties between 5:00-7:30 p.m. CDT before exiting into southeast Nebraska. As mentioned, Nuckolls County bore the brunt of severe weather, with one severe storm lifting north out of Jewell County Kansas, and another (the tornado-producer) intensifying as it drifted east from Webster County. North of this primary zone of strong to severe convection, a few strong storms also flared up within the northeast quadrant of South Central Nebraska, including one that dropped small hail in eastern Nance County around 7:30 p.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, the primary instigator for severe weather was a strong, closed low tracking eastward along the Nebraska-South Dakota border and a negatively-tilted shortwave trough to its east-southeast kicking out across the Central Plains. At mid-afternoon, the primary surface low of around 996 millibars was centered in central South Dakota, while a secondary, slightly weaker low developed in west central Kansas. These two lows were connected by a rather classic, north-south oriented dryline/cold front combination. The South Central Nebraska severe storms erupted along the leading dryline, in an environment characterized by surface temperatures in the mid-70s F, dewpoints in the mid-upper 50s and south-southeast winds of 15-20 MPH with higher gusts. The mesoscale environment was certainly supportive of supercell storms, featuring up to 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 40-50 knots.

These hail-producers consisted of a cluster of four separate supercell storms, all within close proximity to one another. The largest reported hail up to golf ball size fell five miles east of Jewell. A short time later, a separate storm dumped hail on Formoso for 20-straight minutes, the largest of which was ping pong ball size (most was smaller). A third storm likely also produced large hail in northeastern parts of the county (despite a lack of reports from within the county itself), as evidenced by golf ball size stones reported in nearby Superior, Nebraska. Radar indicated that a fourth severe storm likely affected west-central Mitchell County, but there were also no verifying ground truth reports. While hail was the main story in Jewell County, it was narrowly spared a tornado threat, as separate tornadoes touched down in bordering Nuckolls and Republic counties.

However, of these two days, Thursday the 7th took top prize, featuring several hours of sustained speeds generally 30-45 MPH and a handful of severe-criteria gusts to around 60 MPH as measured by mesonet stations. Although the entire late-morning through late-afternoon was quite windy, most of the peak gusts occurred between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. CDT, with the highest-known speed of 62 MPH occurring near Red Cloud. Damage reports were few, but a semi-truck was toppled on Highway 6 just east of Holdrege. At primary automated airport stations within the area, peak gusts included 55 MPH at Grand Island and Ord, and 53 MPH at Hastings. In some places, blowing dust resulted in mainly minor visibility reductions. Winds eased considerably by sunset, to under 10 MPH by 9 p.m. CDT. ||Judging by the surface weather map, this was a somewhat unusual high wind event for the local area, as the west-to-east pressure gradient across Nebraska was only around 10 millibars at most. However, very deep mixing (up to around 700 millibars) into strong, unidirectional flow aloft, along with efficient downward-momentum transfer on the backside of a shortwave trough diving southeast through the Missouri Valley proved plenty sufficient. On the larger scale of the mid-upper levels, Nebraska resided squarely under the core of intense northwesterly flow within the interface between a sprawling trough centered over the Great Lakes and a highly amplified ridge over the western United States.",A 62 mph non-thunderstorm wind gust was measured by a mesonet located 4 miles north-northeast of Red Cloud.,CSV

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of central/eastern Kansas under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail in parts of central and eastern Kansas, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",,CSV

Although ground-truth storm reports were limited, quarter size hail was reported shortly after 4 p.m. CDT in rural southern Osborne County. As it turned out, this limited North Central Kansas activity was actually the northward extent of a more widespread area of strong to severe storms that mainly impacted portions of central and northeastern Kansas. ||The first storm formed near the Osborne-Russell County line between 3:30-4:00 p.m. CDT and quickly intensified as it drifted northeast, yielding the aforementioned report of quarter-size hail. Over the course of the next few hours, this initial isolated storm quickly morphed/grew upscale into a cluster of multicell convection that propagated east-northeast along various outflow boundaries, passing through portions of Mitchell and Jewell counties along the way.  By 7 p.m. CDT, storms had all but vacated this North Central Kansas area, although they persisted just off to the south and east for a few more hours. This event was a classic case of intense heating (and associated steep low-level lapse rates) along with subtle surface convergence coming together to ignite vigorous convection despite an overall-lack of large-scale forcing. In the mid-upper levels, flow was seasonably-weak as the Central Plains resided within a northward-building ridge axis, well-downstream from a broad trough axis near the Pacific Coast. At the surface, a fairly subtle northwest-southeast oriented confluence zone set up across the area during the afternoon, providing subtle lift. As temperatures soared to between 100-105 F, the intense heating and subtle convergence was sufficient to pop storms. Around the time of the Osborne County hail report, mesoscale parameters featured considerable instability with mixed-layer CAPE around 3000 J/kg, but no more than 20-25 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

Although radar data suggested that severe-criteria wind and/or hail might have occurred, the only ground-truth report consisted of nickel size hail stones in rural southern Osborne County shortly before 6 p.m. CDT. ||These multicell storms initiated along a rather well-defined cold front tracking southeast through the Central Plains. Prior to the development of this stronger convection, much of the day featured hit-and-miss weak rain showers, rooted above a capping inversion. Eventually though, enough boundary-layer heating occurred just ahead of the front by late afternoon to allow more vigorous surface-based storm development, including the small cluster of convection in Osborne/Mitchell counties that initiated between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT, quickly peaked in intensity and had already started weakening by 7 p.m. CDT. These North Central Kansas storms were actually the northeastern extension of somewhat more widespread activity that focused within central and southwestern Kansas. After 7 p.m. CDT, numerous post-frontal rain showers and weak thunderstorms continued streaming over parts of the local area for several more hours, but nothing else came close to being strong/severe. This was a fairly common early-summer convective event for North Central Kansas, with low-level forcing focused along the aforementioned surface cold front. In the mid-upper levels, the Central Plains received a glancing shot of lift during the afternoon and evening from a vigorous low pressure system churning eastward along the North Dakota/Canada border area. The cap was finally able to break along the cold front as  surface temperatures climbed into the mid-90s F with dewpoints generally in the mid-60s. This yielded steep low-level lapse rates, with late afternoon mesoscale parameters featuring mixed-layer CAPE up to around 2000 J/kg but only fairly modest deep-layer wind shear to around 30 knots.",,CSV

Although these storms yielded very few severe weather reports, one of them consisted of a brief landspout tornado in central Adams County. This EF0-rated tornado, which touched down roughly 2.5 miles southwest of Juniata around 4:30 p.m. CDT, tracked only a very short distance but partially ripped the roof from a metal outbuilding along the way. About an hour later, a trained spotter northwest of Red Cloud reported a combination of nickel size hail and wind gusts to 75 MPH (as measured by a personal weather station). ||This fairly localized and short-duration severe weather event got underway during peak afternoon heating along a classic, slowly-southeastward-tracking front. Initial development took place between 4:00-4:30 p.m. CDT, consisting of a broken line of convection extending roughly along a line from Minden-Hastings-Giltner. As is often the case, the landspout tornado near Juniata materialized early in storm maturity, just as the initial updrafts were strengthening in the presence of enhanced low-level vorticity along the surface frontal zone. As this broken line headed southeast around 20 MPH, most of it remained sub-severe and even weakened. However, the southwestern flank intensified through western Webster County, producing the aforementioned severe wind gusts before exiting southward into Kansas between 6:00-6:30 p.m. CDT. A short time later, a secondary narrow line of storms popped up over the York County area but remained sub-severe. By 8 p.m. CDT, all of South Central Nebraska found itself storm-free for the remainder of the night. In the mid-upper levels, the main driving force for this event was a broad shortwave trough sinking southeast across the Dakotas into eastern Nebraska over the course of the afternoon and evening. This wave was embedded within strengthening northwesterly flow aloft, with the Central Plains residing on the downstream side of a pronounced western CONUS ridge. At the surface, the aforementioned cold front roughly bisected South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast around the time of storm development, trailing well-southward from a weak low pressure center in eastern North Dakota. Near and ahead of this boundary, modestly-unstable conditions were noted over the local area as temperatures warmed into the mid-80s F and dewpoints averaged in the mid-50s to around 60 F, promoting mixed-layer CAPE up to around 1500 J/kg in the presence of deep-layer wind shear up to 35 knots.",This landspout tornado briefly touched down roughly 2.5 miles southwest of Juniata. Damage was confined to a roof being partially torn off of a metal outbuilding. Maximum wind speed was estimated to be between 75 and 80 MPH.,CSV

The majority of severe storms targeted areas west of the Highway 281 corridor, mainly producing damaging winds and locally heavy rainfall/flooding, along with a few reports of large hail. Some of the more noteworthy wind and/or wind damage reports included: a measured 75 MPH gust in the Loomis area with power lines and trees down, measured gusts of 70 MPH near Norman and 68 MPH near Kearney, estimated 70 MPH winds in Beaver City and estimated 60 MPH winds in Lexington with 8-10 inch diameter tree limbs down. While most wind damage occurred between 7-9 p.m. CDT in close proximity to actual severe storms, strong to marginally-severe outflow winds managed to surge 20+ miles out ahead of the primary precipitation cores around sunset. This outflow yielded measured gusts around 50 MPH at the Grand Island and Hastings airports and even toppled a 10-inch diameter tree on the eastern fringe of Hastings. Later in the night, a completely separate, southward-rushing storm complex entered northeastern portions of the local area (counties mainly east of Highway 281 and along/north of Interstate 80) in a weakening state, but still produced northerly outflow of 50+ MPH, including 55 MPH measured at the York airport shortly after 1 a.m. CDT. There were fewer reports of large hail during this event, but stones up to golf ball size were confirmed near Ashton early in the evening, and also near Ord closer to sunset (quarter to ping pong ball size in Ord itself). ||Turning to hydrology issues, although they were fairly isolated/localized in nature, there were three bulls eyes of heavy, radar-estimated rainfall of at least 1.50-3.00 that fell in a short time and produced verified flooding. Going in chronological order, the first pocket of heavy rain targeted east-central Sherman County as a nearly-stationary storm parked itself overhead for roughly 2.5 hours between 4:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. This resulted in flooding of Deer Creek, which covered a portion of at least one rural road between Rockville and Ashton for a time. Around the time rain started easing up over Sherman County, additional pockets of short-fused heavy rain focused over portions of central Dawson and west-central Phelps counties mainly between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in several county road closures in the Cozad/Lexington and Bertrand/Loomis areas. Although there were almost no official gauge totals from the very-heaviest rain zones, Lexington airport tallied 2.56. Outside of these three aforementioned pockets of very heavy rain, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 during this event, and hardly even a drop within most central counties along the Highway 281 corridor.||Taking a closer look at timing, the first, isolated storms of the day flared up during the peak heating hours of 3-6 p.m. CDT, primarily within Sherman and Dawson counties. Then, during the ensuing four hours through 10 p.m. CDT, storm coverage greatly increased within the western half of South Central Nebraska, both as a result of new development along local outflow boundaries and also from additional storms expanding northeastward into the area out of southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. After 10 p.m. CDT, the onset of diurnal cooling resulted in a steady weakening/dissipation of the main round of afternoon/evening convection. However, primarily between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 18th, a completely separate southward-tracking storm complex entered mainly northeastern portions of South Central Nebraska in a steadily-weakening state. Through the remainder of the night, scattered weak thunderstorms lingered over eastern portions of the area (especially within the Highway 81 counties), but by sunrise on the 18th nearly all of South Central Nebraska was rain-free. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots), initially limiting the overall magnitude/coverage of severe storms. However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the overall-hottest, most humid days of summer 2016 within South Central Nebraska as temperatures generally topped out 96-100 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada. At the surface, there were no pronounced boundaries of note over the local area, although a somewhat subtle inverted trough extended across Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast.","Quarter to golf ball size hail fell from a nearly stationary storm in the Ashton area.

The majority of severe storms targeted areas west of the Highway 281 corridor, mainly producing damaging winds and locally heavy rainfall/flooding, along with a few reports of large hail. Some of the more noteworthy wind and/or wind damage reports included: a measured 75 MPH gust in the Loomis area with power lines and trees down, measured gusts of 70 MPH near Norman and 68 MPH near Kearney, estimated 70 MPH winds in Beaver City and estimated 60 MPH winds in Lexington with 8-10 inch diameter tree limbs down. While most wind damage occurred between 7-9 p.m. CDT in close proximity to actual severe storms, strong to marginally-severe outflow winds managed to surge 20+ miles out ahead of the primary precipitation cores around sunset. This outflow yielded measured gusts around 50 MPH at the Grand Island and Hastings airports and even toppled a 10-inch diameter tree on the eastern fringe of Hastings. Later in the night, a completely separate, southward-rushing storm complex entered northeastern portions of the local area (counties mainly east of Highway 281 and along/north of Interstate 80) in a weakening state, but still produced northerly outflow of 50+ MPH, including 55 MPH measured at the York airport shortly after 1 a.m. CDT. There were fewer reports of large hail during this event, but stones up to golf ball size were confirmed near Ashton early in the evening, and also near Ord closer to sunset (quarter to ping pong ball size in Ord itself). ||Turning to hydrology issues, although they were fairly isolated/localized in nature, there were three bulls eyes of heavy, radar-estimated rainfall of at least 1.50-3.00 that fell in a short time and produced verified flooding. Going in chronological order, the first pocket of heavy rain targeted east-central Sherman County as a nearly-stationary storm parked itself overhead for roughly 2.5 hours between 4:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. This resulted in flooding of Deer Creek, which covered a portion of at least one rural road between Rockville and Ashton for a time. Around the time rain started easing up over Sherman County, additional pockets of short-fused heavy rain focused over portions of central Dawson and west-central Phelps counties mainly between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in several county road closures in the Cozad/Lexington and Bertrand/Loomis areas. Although there were almost no official gauge totals from the very-heaviest rain zones, Lexington airport tallied 2.56. Outside of these three aforementioned pockets of very heavy rain, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 during this event, and hardly even a drop within most central counties along the Highway 281 corridor.||Taking a closer look at timing, the first, isolated storms of the day flared up during the peak heating hours of 3-6 p.m. CDT, primarily within Sherman and Dawson counties. Then, during the ensuing four hours through 10 p.m. CDT, storm coverage greatly increased within the western half of South Central Nebraska, both as a result of new development along local outflow boundaries and also from additional storms expanding northeastward into the area out of southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. After 10 p.m. CDT, the onset of diurnal cooling resulted in a steady weakening/dissipation of the main round of afternoon/evening convection. However, primarily between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 18th, a completely separate southward-tracking storm complex entered mainly northeastern portions of South Central Nebraska in a steadily-weakening state. Through the remainder of the night, scattered weak thunderstorms lingered over eastern portions of the area (especially within the Highway 81 counties), but by sunrise on the 18th nearly all of South Central Nebraska was rain-free. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots), initially limiting the overall magnitude/coverage of severe storms. However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the overall-hottest, most humid days of summer 2016 within South Central Nebraska as temperatures generally topped out 96-100 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada.

However, shortly before 130 a.m. CDT on this early Thursday morning, a brief intensification along the southwestern flank of the storm complex yielded a lone report of measured 60 MPH gusts accompanied by penny size hail in the town of Edison.||The leading edge of this linear MCS first entered the northern and western fringes of South Central Nebraska between 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. CDT, gradually weakening (for the most part) after packing more of a punch earlier in the evening farther to the north and west. However, during the following hour, the aforementioned brief uptick in intensity over primarily Gosper, Furnas and Harlan counties resulted in the severe gusts in Edison. Shortly thereafter, radar again indicated weakening storm intensity as the main part of the complex exited southward into northern Kansas by 2:30 a.m. CDT. Additional showers/weak storms percolated on-and-off through the remainder of the pre-dawn hours, but nothing more came remotely close to being severe.  Rainfall-wise, although there were no reports of impactful flooding, these storms dumped a quick 1-2 inches on parts of mainly Furnas and Harlan counties. This was a fairly standard-issue early-summer nocturnal convective event, as the Central Plains resided under seasonably-strong northwesterly flow in the mid-upper levels, directed between a broad trough centered over the northeast United States/southeast Canada and a high pressure ridge centered near the Four Corners region. At the surface, there we no notable features locally, with only broad, weak high pressure and dewpoints averaging in the mid-60s F ahead of the incoming MCS.

The majority of severe storms targeted areas west of the Highway 281 corridor, mainly producing damaging winds and locally heavy rainfall/flooding, along with a few reports of large hail. Some of the more noteworthy wind and/or wind damage reports included: a measured 75 MPH gust in the Loomis area with power lines and trees down, measured gusts of 70 MPH near Norman and 68 MPH near Kearney, estimated 70 MPH winds in Beaver City and estimated 60 MPH winds in Lexington with 8-10 inch diameter tree limbs down. While most wind damage occurred between 7-9 p.m. CDT in close proximity to actual severe storms, strong to marginally-severe outflow winds managed to surge 20+ miles out ahead of the primary precipitation cores around sunset. This outflow yielded measured gusts around 50 MPH at the Grand Island and Hastings airports and even toppled a 10-inch diameter tree on the eastern fringe of Hastings. Later in the night, a completely separate, southward-rushing storm complex entered northeastern portions of the local area (counties mainly east of Highway 281 and along/north of Interstate 80) in a weakening state, but still produced northerly outflow of 50+ MPH, including 55 MPH measured at the York airport shortly after 1 a.m. CDT. There were fewer reports of large hail during this event, but stones up to golf ball size were confirmed near Ashton early in the evening, and also near Ord closer to sunset (quarter to ping pong ball size in Ord itself). ||Turning to hydrology issues, although they were fairly isolated/localized in nature, there were three bulls eyes of heavy, radar-estimated rainfall of at least 1.50-3.00 that fell in a short time and produced verified flooding. Going in chronological order, the first pocket of heavy rain targeted east-central Sherman County as a nearly-stationary storm parked itself overhead for roughly 2.5 hours between 4:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. This resulted in flooding of Deer Creek, which covered a portion of at least one rural road between Rockville and Ashton for a time. Around the time rain started easing up over Sherman County, additional pockets of short-fused heavy rain focused over portions of central Dawson and west-central Phelps counties mainly between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in several county road closures in the Cozad/Lexington and Bertrand/Loomis areas. Although there were almost no official gauge totals from the very-heaviest rain zones, Lexington airport tallied 2.56. Outside of these three aforementioned pockets of very heavy rain, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 during this event, and hardly even a drop within most central counties along the Highway 281 corridor.||Taking a closer look at timing, the first, isolated storms of the day flared up during the peak heating hours of 3-6 p.m. CDT, primarily within Sherman and Dawson counties. Then, during the ensuing four hours through 10 p.m. CDT, storm coverage greatly increased within the western half of South Central Nebraska, both as a result of new development along local outflow boundaries and also from additional storms expanding northeastward into the area out of southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. After 10 p.m. CDT, the onset of diurnal cooling resulted in a steady weakening/dissipation of the main round of afternoon/evening convection. However, primarily between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 18th, a completely separate southward-tracking storm complex entered mainly northeastern portions of South Central Nebraska in a steadily-weakening state. Through the remainder of the night, scattered weak thunderstorms lingered over eastern portions of the area (especially within the Highway 81 counties), but by sunrise on the 18th nearly all of South Central Nebraska was rain-free. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots), initially limiting the overall magnitude/coverage of severe storms. However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the overall-hottest, most humid days of summer 2016 within South Central Nebraska as temperatures generally topped out 96-100 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada.

Later in the night, a completely separate, southward-rushing storm complex entered northeastern portions of the local area (counties mainly east of Highway 281 and along/north of Interstate 80) in a weakening state, but still produced northerly outflow of 50+ MPH, including 55 MPH measured at the York airport shortly after 1 a.m. CDT. There were fewer reports of large hail during this event, but stones up to golf ball size were confirmed near Ashton early in the evening, and also near Ord closer to sunset (quarter to ping pong ball size in Ord itself). ||Turning to hydrology issues, although they were fairly isolated/localized in nature, there were three bulls eyes of heavy, radar-estimated rainfall of at least 1.50-3.00 that fell in a short time and produced verified flooding. Going in chronological order, the first pocket of heavy rain targeted east-central Sherman County as a nearly-stationary storm parked itself overhead for roughly 2.5 hours between 4:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. This resulted in flooding of Deer Creek, which covered a portion of at least one rural road between Rockville and Ashton for a time. Around the time rain started easing up over Sherman County, additional pockets of short-fused heavy rain focused over portions of central Dawson and west-central Phelps counties mainly between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in several county road closures in the Cozad/Lexington and Bertrand/Loomis areas. Although there were almost no official gauge totals from the very-heaviest rain zones, Lexington airport tallied 2.56. Outside of these three aforementioned pockets of very heavy rain, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 during this event, and hardly even a drop within most central counties along the Highway 281 corridor.||Taking a closer look at timing, the first, isolated storms of the day flared up during the peak heating hours of 3-6 p.m. CDT, primarily within Sherman and Dawson counties. Then, during the ensuing four hours through 10 p.m. CDT, storm coverage greatly increased within the western half of South Central Nebraska, both as a result of new development along local outflow boundaries and also from additional storms expanding northeastward into the area out of southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. After 10 p.m. CDT, the onset of diurnal cooling resulted in a steady weakening/dissipation of the main round of afternoon/evening convection. However, primarily between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 18th, a completely separate southward-tracking storm complex entered mainly northeastern portions of South Central Nebraska in a steadily-weakening state. Through the remainder of the night, scattered weak thunderstorms lingered over eastern portions of the area (especially within the Highway 81 counties), but by sunrise on the 18th nearly all of South Central Nebraska was rain-free. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots), initially limiting the overall magnitude/coverage of severe storms. However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the overall-hottest, most humid days of summer 2016 within South Central Nebraska as temperatures generally topped out 96-100 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada.

According to radar data and very limited ground-truth, the only severe storm to impact this portion of North Central Kansas initiated over far northeastern Phillips County between 5:00-5:30 p.m. CDT. It then expanded in size during the next 90 minutes, drifting slowly westward through the county before eventually weakening somewhat around 7 p.m. CDT as it merged with a larger storm complex near the Norton County line. Along the way, quarter size hail was reported 13 miles northeast of Phillipsburg. Despite a lack of ground-truth rainfall and flooding reports from northern Phillips County, radar estimated that at least 1.50-3.00��� drenched the area mainly between 6-9 p.m. CDT, likely resulting in minor flooding issues. However, this heavy rain swath was the exception within these six counties, as most of southern Phillips, western Smith, Rooks and Osborne counties received less than 1��� of rain, with almost none whatsoever falling in Jewell, Mitchell and eastern Smith. ||Further examining the timing/evolution of convection within the local area, the aforementioned Phillips County severe storm was the first, semi-isolated storm of the day as it got underway between 5:00-5:30 p.m. CDT and started tracking west. Then between 6-8 p.m. CDT, a proliferation of outflow boundaries emanating from convection that initially developed in northwest and central Kansas resulted in a steady increase in storm coverage over Phillips and Rooks counties. During the following few hours, a north-south line of strong storms briefly organized over Osborne and western Smith counties but largely weakened by 10 p.m. CDT. Thereafter, only weak thunderstorm and widespread shower activity persisted within parts of the area into the very early morning hours of Saturday the 18th before dissipating and/or departing. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots). However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the hotter, more humid days of summer 2016 within North Central Kansas as temperatures generally topped out 99-102 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada. At the surface, there were no pronounced boundaries of note over the local area as steady southeast breezes prevailed, although a somewhat subtle confluence zone was noted from central into northwest Kansas.",,CSV

Thunderstorms had developed over western Kansas by mid-afternoon and, by 5:30 p.m. CST, they began moving into north central Kansas. The storms were mostly short line-segments of multicell storms, but there was one supercell that lifted out of Ellis County into southeastern Rooks County. This storm was producing a tornado upon entering Rooks County, but the tornado quickly dissipated after crossing into the County. This supercell cycled and did spawn another short-track EF-1 tornado just northeast of where the previous tornado ended. This storm then merged with the developing squall line which swept east across the rest of north central Kansas. Severe hail was reported in many locations across Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell Counties, the largest of which was 2 inches over west-central Osborne County. This line of storms exited north central Kansas by 11 p.m. CST. However, new severe thunderstorms were already developing to the southwest, apparently along the outflow boundary left by the preceding storms. These storms produced hail up to the size of golf balls in multiple locations between 11:15 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. CST.

The main impact with these storms was the prolonged heavy rainfall that occurred.  The majority of the rainfall fell east of Highway 83 between Highways 34 and 89.  However McCook was close enough to the long lasting rainfall for flash flooding to occur in town where Highway 83 was closed along with numerous other roads.  The water was so deep that cars stalled and were abandoned.,Repeated rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall continued over the flood area into the overnight hours.  Highway 83 was closed due to stalled vehicles being stalled and abandoned on the highway.  Numerous other roads were also closed due to the flooding.

The main impact from these storms was flash flooding over Cheyenne, Decatur, Norton, and Graham counties where estimated rainfall amounts of up to ten inches fell.  Many roads in northern Cheyenne County had washouts three to four feet deep, with a few washouts eight to twelve feet deep.  Road crews had to remove silt off Highway 36 west of Bird City where water flowed over the road.  The worst of the flooding was over southern Norton and northern Graham counties where numerous roads were washed out and Lenora was flooded.  The flash flooding transitioned to flooding during the overnight hours as the moderate to heavy rainfall moved to the east.  Swift water rescues were conducted in southern Norton County.

Initially, the first storms moved to the northeast, but then they slowed and began drifting to the southeast. Other storms began developing around 6 p.m. CST, and exhibited multi-cell characteristics. By 8 p.m. CST, multiple cell mergers had resulted in a pair of small thunderstorm clusters oriented west-northwest to east-southeast, from Hitchcock County Nebraska to Graham County Kansas. Shortly thereafter, other storms erupted between these two clusters, resulting in the completion of a common cold pool.

The southern edge of the cold pool remained quasi-stationary, with storms propagating southeastward along and to the north of it. Repeated thunderstorm activity, as well as the slow movement of the storms, resulted in excessive rainfall over Rooks and Osborne Counties as well as several other counties to the south, west, and northwest.

Other storms began developing around 6 p.m. CST, and exhibited multi-cell characteristics. By 8 p.m. CST, multiple cell mergers had resulted in a pair of small thunderstorm clusters oriented west-northwest to east-southeast, from Hitchcock County Nebraska to Graham County Kansas. Shortly thereafter, other storms erupted between these two clusters, resulting in the completion of a common cold pool.

The prolonged heavy rainfall from the storms led to flash flooding along the Highway 25 corridor in northern Wichita and southern Logan counties.",Heavy rainfall from slow moving and training thunderstorms produced rainfall rates of an inch or more per hour for three consecutive hours.

The supercell thunderstorm continued into Morris and Wabaunsee counties where it produced 2 more tornadoes before dissipating that evening.,The long track violent tornado began 1-2 miles NNE of Niles Kansas and destroyed 2 homes in Ottawa county before crossing into Dickinson county north of Solomon.  The tornado tracked 2-3 miles north of the city of Abilene following a meandering path approximately east along 2700 avenue in Dickinson county before veering southeast and crossing interstate 70 approx. 2 miles west of the city of Chapman.  The tornado then moved ESE and then east along a path around 1 mile south of Chapman destroying 1 farmstead and several other homes in the area.  The worst damage was done to a farmstead 1 mile southwest of Chapman along old highway 40 where the home was destroyed and all outbuildings were blown away.  The sub floor of the home was removed from a bolted sill plate and the poured concrete foundation was cracked on the south side exposing the rebar where the strongest forces from the lifting structure occurred as it was being removed and blown away likely occurred.  Much of the brick facade of the home did remain where it fell around the structure however so the area was not swept clean. Winds approaching 200 mph were likely in this area while a woman home at the time took shelter in the basement and was ok with only superficial injuries.

Many roads in northern Cheyenne County had washouts three to four feet deep, with a few washouts eight to twelve feet deep.  Road crews had to remove silt off Highway 36 west of Bird City where water flowed over the road.  The worst of the flooding was over southern Norton and northern Graham counties where numerous roads were washed out and Lenora was flooded.  The flash flooding transitioned to flooding during the overnight hours as the moderate to heavy rainfall moved to the east.  Swift water rescues were conducted in southern Norton County.  One fatality was reported from the flooding in Norton County.  The flooding persisted into the evening of the fourth.",Runoff from prolonged heavy rainfall caused a draw on the east side of CR 19 to washout back across onto the road.  The washout was eight to twelve feet deep.,CSV

In the early evening hours, scattered post-frontal showers began to develop over south central Nebraska, east of Highway 281. Just after 7 p.m. CST, several small thunderstorms developed over southern Hamilton County, and they expanded as the small cluster headed northeast into York and Polk Counties. The strongest storm was on the southern fringe of this cluster, and it appeared to be a mini-supercell as it moved to the right (due east) of all the other cells through central York County. This storm affected the County between 815 and 915 p.m. CST. The first report of hail was the size of nickels in the town of Bradshaw, around 830 p.m. CST. Between 840 and 900 p.m. CST, hail from three-quarters of an inch up to golf ball size was reported in and around York. Through the rest of the evening, the narrow swath of showers and embedded thunderstorms expanded southwestward to the Holdrege area, but there were no other strong or severe storms.||A wavy quasi-stationary front extended from the lower Great Lakes to weak low pressure near Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A cold front then extended southwest from this low across Nebraska into Colorado. Both of these fronts gradually sank south into Kansas through the day, with high pressure building in from the northwest. In the upper-levels, west-southwest flow was over the Country, with a trough over the northwest U.S., and a slight tendency for higher heights over the Gulf Coast States. These storms developed from the release of elevated instability. In the preconvective environment, surface temperatures were in the lower 60s and dewpoints were in the upper 50s, and winds were gusting up to 20 kts from the north. However, because mid-level lapse rates were at least 7.5 deg C/km, MUCAPE was around 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 30-35 kts and effective SRH was 200-300 m2/s2.",,CSV

The strongest storm was on the southern fringe of this cluster, and it appeared to be a mini-supercell as it moved to the right (due east) of all the other cells through central York County. This storm affected the County between 815 and 915 p.m. CST. The first report of hail was the size of nickels in the town of Bradshaw, around 830 p.m. CST.

A cold front then extended southwest from this low across Nebraska into Colorado. Both of these fronts gradually sank south into Kansas through the day, with high pressure building in from the northwest. In the upper-levels, west-southwest flow was over the Country, with a trough over the northwest U.S., and a slight tendency for higher heights over the Gulf Coast States. These storms developed from the release of elevated instability. In the preconvective environment, surface temperatures were in the lower 60s and dewpoints were in the upper 50s, and winds were gusting up to 20 kts from the north. However, because mid-level lapse rates were at least 7.5 deg C/km, MUCAPE was around 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 30-35 kts and effective SRH was 200-300 m2/s2.",,CSV

While most places tallied only 0.50-1.50 in total, a rather narrow, southwest-northeast swath centered through western/northern Osborne County into far southwestern Jewell County picked up higher amounts into the 2.00-3.50 range, resulting in both short-term areal flooding and also minor flooding along the South Fork Solomon River from near Alton downstream through the Osborne area. Officially, 18-24 hour rainfall totals featured 3.21 at a Kansas Mesonet site on the north side of Osborne and 2.95 at an Osborne CoCoRaHS station. This was almost entirely a heavy rain event, with only one report of nickel size hail between Osborne and Downs shortly before 1 p.m. CDT. ||The first round of rain (round 1) was by far the most significant and occurred mainly between the mid-morning and early afternoon hours. A slow-moving multicell storm cluster initially flared up over western Osborne County between 11 a.m. and noon CDT, then drifted through northern Osborne County into Jewell County before weakening and eventually departing the local area between 2-3 p.m. CDT. This round 1 dumped generally 1.50 to 3 over the heart of this swath, including 2.50 at the Kansas Mesonet site in Osborne (1.77 of which fell in 45 minutes) and an unofficial public report of 3.5 south of Alton. As a result, fairly significant short term flooding (including street flooding) ensued during the early afternoon. While most of this initial flooding abated within a few hours, enough runoff eventually drained into the South Fork Solomon River to push the automated gauge at Osborne above its minor flood stage of 14 feet by 7 p.m. CDT. Although not as impactful as round 1, another batch of light to moderate rain blossomed across nearly all of North Central Kansas mainly between 1-6 a.m. CDT on the 25th, leaving behind another widespread 0.50-1.00, including 0.70 at the Kansas Mesonet site in Osborne. If nothing else, round 2 kept the South Fork Solomon River above flood stage a bit longer, as the Osborne gauge crested at 15.8 feet (1.8 ft. above flood stage) at 12:45 a.m. CDT on the 25th but didn't drop below flood stage until 12 hours later. ||Briefly looking at the meteorological background of this small-scale flooding event, the Central Plains was under a seasonably-active southwesterly flow regime in the mid-upper levels as a series of low-amplitude disturbances streamed overhead, well to the south of a parent low centered in far south central Canada. At the surface, North Central Kansas was positioned slightly north of a quasi-stationary front stretched across southern and eastern Kansas. Despite seasonably-low mixed-layer CAPE averaging under 1000 J/kg, the combination of fairly strong mid-upper flow and a deep, moist airmass characterized by precipitable water values around 1.5 helped fuel the heavy rain.","Approximately four inches of water were rushing over a street in Osborne, as reported by a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper who submitted photos via social media. A Kansas Mesonet gauge in Osborne recorded 1.77 inches between 12:15 p.m. and 1 p.m. CDT...a span of 45 minutes. This mesonet ended up with a 24-hour total of 3.21 as of 6 a.m. CDT on the 25th, but the majority of this fell during the afternoon of the 24th (an additional 0.70 inches fell overnight into the 25th). In addition, a CoCoRaHS station in Osborne reported a 24-hour total of 2.95 as of 7 a.m. CDT on the 25th.",CSV

There was also a lone report from a storm chaser of a weak, brief EF0 rope tornado in extreme southern Sherman County around sunset. Generally speaking, this event consisted of two distinct rounds of strong to severe storms over roughly an eight-hour period, with a decent break in between. During round 1, which focused during the early evening from 6-8 p.m. CDT, a quick-moving convective cluster charged east-northeast through mainly Nuckolls and Thayer counties, resulting in several reports of estimated 50-70 MPH wind gusts, highlighted by estimated 70 MPH gusts west of Deshler and 65 MPH near Belvidere. As this initial round was in the process of departing the local area into southeast Nebraska between 8-9 p.m. CDT, attention shifted off to the northwest as an isolated cell with occasional supercell characteristics drifted into southern Sherman County from the west. Although radar data suggested this storm was in the process of weakening, it nonetheless produced the aforementioned brief tornado southwest of Rockville before fading away. From 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. CDT, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska found itself storm-free as all active weather focused off to the east and also northwest. Eventually though, round 2 of strong to severe storms targeted primarily Dawson County between 1-2 a.m. CDT as a broken line of convection over western Nebraska briefly morphed into a small-scale bow echo.

Although ground-truth severe verification did not materialize from each of these counties, there were still several reports of wind gusts in the 50-65 MPH range, highlighted by a measured gust of 63 MPH at Glen Elder and estimated 60 MPH at Cawker City. Within the local six-county area, initial development flared up over Osborne County between 4-5 p.m. CDT. During the ensuing few hours, this multicell cluster tracked northeast before largely exiting into south central Nebraska by 7 p.m. CDT. Although there were no additional severe storms, another cluster of non-severe convection brushed up into Mitchell County out of central Kansas a bit later in the evening, and hours later (well after midnight), the weakening remnants of a Nebraska storm complex limped into areas primarily north of Highway 36.

Within this local area, the sole ground-truth report consisted of nickel size hail near the Interstate 80 Henderson exit around 7:30 p.m. CDT. Breaking down this rather low-key event, the first isolated cells of the afternoon popped up over northern Webster and northern Clay counties between 5-6 p.m. CDT. While the southwestern storm soon faded, the northeastern one intensified, with radar suggesting that hail to around quarter size might have fallen in southeastern Hamilton County especially between 6:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. However, there was no ground-truth verification of hail quite this large, with only the aforementioned nickel size report arriving a short time later from barely over the York County line. Thereafter, a few additional non-severe storms drifted through portions of York, Polk and northern Fillmore counties for a short while longer, but by 9 p.m. CDT all of this activity had either dissipated or vacated off into eastern Nebraska, leaving South Central Nebraska quiet for the remainder of the night. ||For a few days leading up this event, it appeared that South Central Nebraska could realize a more substantial severe weather threat. However, thanks largely to the axis of a fairly weak mid-level shortwave trough departing just east of the local area during the afternoon and evening, the greater coverage/severity of storms also concentrated slightly to the east, with local counties only getting a glancing blow. On the larger scale of the mid-upper levels, the aforementioned departing disturbance was embedded in modest west-southwest flow, well to the south of a more powerful closed low churning across southern Saskatchewan.

Extensive flooding ensued along the Little Blue River and its tributaries (including Ash Creek) and numerous rural county roads/bridges were flooded out/damaged, some of which remained barricaded for several days.

There, extensive damage occurred to electrical boxes, buildings and picnic tables, and the park remained closed to the public for over two weeks before reopening in mid-September. Along the Little Blue itself, flood waters quickly worked downstream from Ayr, reaching the Pauline area on the morning of the 29th and the automated river gauge near Deweese by early evening. At this gauge site, the river crested around 11 feet (one foot above minor flood stage) during the overnight hours before falling below flood stage on the morning of the 30th. Minor flooding likely continued along the river through much of northeastern Nuckolls County, but no flooding was reported farther downstream into Thayer County.

In an ironic twist, leading up to this event the southern Adams/northern Webster locale had been one of the driest places in the entire state of Nebraska for the summer, having recently been placed in a Severe Drought (D2) category by the U.S. Drought Monitor.

Extensive flooding ensued along the Little Blue River and its tributaries (including Ash Creek) and numerous rural county roads/bridges were flooded out/damaged, some of which remained barricaded for several days. The overall-worst flooding concentrated within south central Adams County, including the Crystal Lake Recreation Area and campground located just north of Ayr along the Little Blue River. There, extensive damage occurred to electrical boxes, buildings and picnic tables, and the park remained closed to the public for over two weeks before reopening in mid-September. Along the Little Blue itself, flood waters quickly worked downstream from Ayr, reaching the Pauline area on the morning of the 29th and the automated river gauge near Deweese by early evening. At this gauge site, the river crested around 11 feet (one foot above minor flood stage) during the overnight hours before falling below flood stage on the morning of the 30th. Minor flooding likely continued along the river through much of northeastern Nuckolls County, but no flooding was reported farther downstream into Thayer County. This event was all about flooding, as thunderstorms otherwise remained sub-severe and yielded no reports of large hail or damaging winds. ||This was likely the most notable flooding event to strike the Adams/Webster County line area in several decades, especially considering that the majority of accumulation occurred in only a four-hour period between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. CDT. Some of the most impressive rain totals featured: 7.27 two miles northeast of Blue Hill (NeRAIN observer), 6.62 four miles southwest of Blue Hill (NWS observer), 5.60 four miles south-southeast of Roseland (NeRAIN), 5.50 in Blue Hill (personal weather station) and 3.81 five miles south-southeast of Deweese (NeRAIN). In an ironic twist, leading up to this event the southern Adams/northern Webster locale had been one of the driest places in the entire state of Nebraska for the summer, having recently been placed in a Severe Drought (D2) category by the U.S. Drought Monitor. As a striking example of this sudden transition from drought to flood, the NWS cooperative observer near Blue Hill tallied merely 2.77 of rain from Jun 1-Aug 27 (roughly 25% of normal) and then received more than twice this amount (6.62) on this single night! ||Taking a closer look at event timing and evolution, things got underway between 9:30-10:30 p.m. CDT on the 28th as thunderstorms erupted along a northwest-southeast axis extending from western Adams County down into Republic/Washington counties in Kansas. Over the next several hours, the northwestern edge of this initial activity evolved into a quasi-stationary storm cluster that essentially anchored itself over the southern Adams/northern Webster area. By 2 a.m. CDT on the 29th, convection finally began to diminish in intensity/rainfall rates, leaving only lingering lighter showers that dissipated completely by 5 a.m. CDT. This was a rather sneaky mesoscale flood event, as although low chances for thunderstorms were in the forecast, computer models (even in the very short term) were not spotlighting the potential for significant flooding.

This resulted from a quasi-stationary, multicell storm cluster remaining anchored over the Furnas/Red Willow County line...just as one storm core would weaken or start to drift slightly to the east, another would pop up and take its place. At long last, possibly in response to a loss of daytime heating, this storm cluster started weakening and drifting east after 9 p.m. CDT, finally dissipating for good in southeastern Furnas County around 11 p.m. CDT. The vast majority of this activity concentrated in the far northwestern and west central part of the county, from around Cambridge southward through rural areas northwest of Wilsonville. In this area, there were several reports of penny to half dollar size hail in and very near Cambridge, with golf ball size stones falling several miles south of town. Not surprisingly given the persistent storm generation, radar rainfall estimates in far west-central Furnas County spiked to at least 3-4 inches. However, there were no ground-truth reports of extremely heavy rain or flash flooding from this bullseye, and official reports from Cambridge itself yielded less than 2 with only minor road flooding. ||In the wake of the Furnas County activity, the late evening and overnight hours featured a completely separate and more widespread area of occasionally-strong storms primarily within the far northern and eastern reaches of South Central Nebraska. This nocturnal activity, which really got going between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. CDT, actually persisted all night and into the next morning in some weakened form before finally exiting the Thayer County area around 10 a.m. CDT on the 2nd. Although radar indicated some potential for hail with a few of these overnight storms, heavy rain was the main feature as a good chunk of counties such as Greeley/Nance/Polk measured at least 1-2 and locally higher (including 2.90 south of Spalding). However, like the earlier Furnas County storms, there were no reports of significant flooding. ||In the mid-upper levels, this was a pretty typical and weakly-forced mid-summer event as South Central Nebraska resided under fairly weak quasi-zonal flow between ridging over the southern CONUS and a potent shortwave trough well to the north over south central Canada. The Furnas County severe storms likely initiated from the combination of a subtle mid-level wave and intense heating/weak convergence along a surface trough aligned from western KS into central NE. With temperatures in the Furnas County area reaching the mid-upper 90s F and dewpoints in the low-mid 60s, convection was able to overcome warm mid level temperatures and become severe in an environment characterized by mixed-layer CAPE of at least 2000 J/kg but only around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear. Later in the night, the uptick in nocturnal convection occurred in classic fashion near the nose of a 30-40 knot low-level jet evident around 850 millibars.",,CSV

Unlike the previous event, during which the axis of heaviest rain fell almost directly over the Solomon basin (including in the city of Osborne), this time around the instigating heavy rain fell in a west-east oriented swath about 10 miles farther south as a multicell storm cluster remained quasi-stationary for nearly three hours from 6-9 p.m. CDT on Tuesday the 30th. Radar rainfall estimation suggested that the heart of this narrow swath across central Osborne County averaged 1.50-3.00. However, a trained spotter near Covert happened to live within a very small (likely no more than a few square miles) bullseye of heaviest rain and reported an unofficial total of 5.50 inches along with water over some rural roads. While most of these initial, short-term areal flooding issues improved during the overnight hours, considerable runoff flowed down smaller streams such as Covert Creek and Kill Creek and eventually into the South Fork Solomon River, where the gauge at Osborne breached minor flood stage of 14 feet around 7 a.m. CDT on Wednesday the 31st. The river crested at 16.7 ft. during the afternoon (2.7 ft. above flood stage) and fell back below flood stage around 10 p.m. CDT. ||The isolated to scattered, slow-moving heavy rain storms that roamed North Central Kansas on both the 30th and 31st occurred in a classic weather pattern for localized/spotty heavy rain and flash flooding largely driven by diurnal heating. In the mid-upper levels, flow was very weak (especially near/below 500 millibars) with broad ridging in place, although weak, transient mid level disturbances were evident in the flow. This subtle forcing aloft interacted with an airmass very moist through a deep layer, featuring impressive precipitable water values in the 1.5 to 2.0 range and tall/skinny CAPE profiles with weak mid-level lapse rates.","The river gage at Osborne along the South Fork Solomon River reported a minor flood, lasting from 6:48 a.m. to 10:13 p.m. CDT on August 31st.

The first thunderstorms began forming just after 3 pm and were part of a broken line of isolated storms that extended from O'neill south to near Kearney, and then southwest into Kansas. A dominant storm developed along the Hall-Howard County line by 4 p.m.. This storm became severe as it continued east, affecting adjoining portions of Hamilton and Merrick Counties through 5:30 pm CST. Around 4:50 pm CST, this storm produced a gustnado near Chapman, along with hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter, and estimated winds around 70 mph. After 5:30 pm, other storms developed in close-proximity, displaying multicell characteristics. An east-west oriented line segment of storms formed across Hamilton and York Counties. This line remained intact until 8 p.m. CST. Storms within this line trained, producing severe hail up to the size of golf balls and flash flooding from several inches of rain. Outflow winds overturned an irrigation pivot and produced blowing dust that reduced the visibility to near zero near Bradshaw. Several reports of gustnadoes were received along the leading edge of the outflow. ||Meanwhile, one storm crossed into Furnas County from Kansas beginning around 4 p.m. CST. Several other thunderstorms developed around it, forming a small mostly sub-severe cluster. The initial storm briefly became severe, producing estimated winds of 85 mph in northern Furnas County. This cluster moved northeast and eventually formed a short line segment that was oriented from northwest to southeast. This line produced winds of 50 to 55 mph in a couple locations in Adams and Clay Counties. It then crossed Hall, Hamilton, and York Counties from 7 to 9 p.m. CST, adding to the already impressive rainfall amounts. Much of northeastern Hamilton County received 4 to 6 inches of rain in less than 6 hours. The highest total was 6.77 inches at Marquette. These high rainfall amounts were surrounded by a larger area of 2 to 3 inches which extended across Hall, Hamilton, and York Counties.

There was also a lone report from a storm chaser of a weak, brief EF0 rope tornado in extreme southern Sherman County around sunset. Generally speaking, this event consisted of two distinct rounds of strong to severe storms over roughly an eight-hour period, with a decent break in between. During round 1, which focused during the early evening from 6-8 p.m. CDT, a quick-moving convective cluster charged east-northeast through mainly Nuckolls and Thayer counties, resulting in several reports of estimated 50-70 MPH wind gusts, highlighted by estimated 70 MPH gusts west of Deshler and 65 MPH near Belvidere. As this initial round was in the process of departing the local area into southeast Nebraska between 8-9 p.m. CDT, attention shifted off to the northwest as an isolated cell with occasional supercell characteristics drifted into southern Sherman County from the west. Although radar data suggested this storm was in the process of weakening, it nonetheless produced the aforementioned brief tornado southwest of Rockville before fading away. From 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. CDT, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska found itself storm-free as all active weather focused off to the east and also northwest. Eventually though, round 2 of strong to severe storms targeted primarily Dawson County between 1-2 a.m. CDT as a broken line of convection over western Nebraska briefly morphed into a small-scale bow echo. This activity yielded reports of quarter size hail in Gothenburg, estimated 60 MPH winds with tree limbs down in Cozad and a measured 56 MPH gust at the Lexington airport. However, this storm complex soon weakened below severe thresholds as it tracked deeper into the local area, and although isolated to scattered storms persisted across various parts of South Central Nebraska until around 5 a.m. CDT on the 29th there were no additional severe weather reports. Rainfall-wise, the vast majority of the area averaged well-under 1 inch, with some pockets of 1-2 concentrated mainly within Nuckolls/Thayer counties from round 1.||Given that this event consisted of different rounds of storms separated in both location and time, it should come as no surprise that the upper air and surface situation was somewhat complex. Starting with the mid-upper levels, forcing was respectable for mid-August as South Central Nebraska was positioned downstream from a broad, slow-moving trough edging from the Northern Rockies toward the Dakotas. Embedded within this mean trough were several smaller-scale shortwaves, each helping to drive the separate rounds of convection. At the surface, a very slow-moving/weak cold front gradually worked its way southeastward through South Central Nebraska during the evening/overnight. Digging a bit deeper, round 1 during the early evening was largely driven by weak convergence and considerable instability focused along a pre-frontal surface trough stretched from southwest KS into southeast NE. Despite fairly weak deep-layer wind shear only around 30 knots, these storms quickly became severe in an environment featuring at least 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and surface dewpoints well into the low-mid 70s F. The second round of storms that arrived later in the night initially developed during the evening well to the west over the High Plains and was tied more closely to the primary mid level vort max approaching from WY and also the actual surface cold front. Even at this late hour, round 2 still had up to around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE to work with.",Wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were estimated by a trained spotter.

Already by noon CDT, strong thunderstorms were underway in Phillips County along a cold front advancing southeast through the region. Over the course of the next few hours convection increased in coverage and intensity as it marched across most of North Central Kansas, primarily producing sporadic wind damage and brief, torrential rainfall. Along the way, a few of the more notable storm reports included: estimated 70 MPH winds south of Alton accompanied by nickel size hail and over 2 of rain in a short time leading to localized flash flooding; measured severe-criteria wind gusts of 78 MPH in Beloit, 63 MPH at Simpson and 60 MPH near Jewell. Between 3-4 p.m. CDT, the main batch of strong to severe storms steadily departed the local area to the east and southeast, ending the severe weather threat for the day. Shortly thereafter, additional storms briefly flared up over Mitchell County but produced only heavy rain, and the entire six-county area was storm-free for the day by 6:30 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, the majority of this North Central Kansas area tallied between 0.50-2.00, with slightly higher amounts focused within southwestern Phillips, central Osborne and southern and eastern Mitchell counties, where brief flooding issues were most prevalent. ||By mid-August standards, the surface cold front that sparked this event was reasonably-strong, featuring gusty north winds in its wake and steadily-falling dewpoints. Just ahead of the front during the early-mid afternoon, surface temperatures climbed into the 80s F with dewpoints into the mid-upper 60s, fostering appreciable mixed-layer CAPE of at least 2000 J/kg.

This resulted from a quasi-stationary, multicell storm cluster remaining anchored over the Furnas/Red Willow County line...just as one storm core would weaken or start to drift slightly to the east, another would pop up and take its place. At long last, possibly in response to a loss of daytime heating, this storm cluster started weakening and drifting east after 9 p.m. CDT, finally dissipating for good in southeastern Furnas County around 11 p.m. CDT. The vast majority of this activity concentrated in the far northwestern and west central part of the county, from around Cambridge southward through rural areas northwest of Wilsonville. In this area, there were several reports of penny to half dollar size hail in and very near Cambridge, with golf ball size stones falling several miles south of town. Not surprisingly given the persistent storm generation, radar rainfall estimates in far west-central Furnas County spiked to at least 3-4 inches. However, there were no ground-truth reports of extremely heavy rain or flash flooding from this bullseye, and official reports from Cambridge itself yielded less than 2 with only minor road flooding. ||In the wake of the Furnas County activity, the late evening and overnight hours featured a completely separate and more widespread area of occasionally-strong storms primarily within the far northern and eastern reaches of South Central Nebraska.

With temperatures in the Furnas County area reaching the mid-upper 90s F and dewpoints in the low-mid 60s, convection was able to overcome warm mid level temperatures and become severe in an environment characterized by mixed-layer CAPE of at least 2000 J/kg but only around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear. Later in the night, the uptick in nocturnal convection occurred in classic fashion near the nose of a 30-40 knot low-level jet evident around 850 millibars.",Estimated wind gusts of 55 to 60  mph also occurred with quarter size hail and heavy rain. Water was over some county roads west of town.,CSV

There was also a lone report from a storm chaser of a weak, brief EF0 rope tornado in extreme southern Sherman County around sunset. Generally speaking, this event consisted of two distinct rounds of strong to severe storms over roughly an eight-hour period, with a decent break in between. During round 1, which focused during the early evening from 6-8 p.m. CDT, a quick-moving convective cluster charged east-northeast through mainly Nuckolls and Thayer counties, resulting in several reports of estimated 50-70 MPH wind gusts, highlighted by estimated 70 MPH gusts west of Deshler and 65 MPH near Belvidere. As this initial round was in the process of departing the local area into southeast Nebraska between 8-9 p.m. CDT, attention shifted off to the northwest as an isolated cell with occasional supercell characteristics drifted into southern Sherman County from the west. Although radar data suggested this storm was in the process of weakening, it nonetheless produced the aforementioned brief tornado southwest of Rockville before fading away. From 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. CDT, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska found itself storm-free as all active weather focused off to the east and also northwest. Eventually though, round 2 of strong to severe storms targeted primarily Dawson County between 1-2 a.m. CDT as a broken line of convection over western Nebraska briefly morphed into a small-scale bow echo. This activity yielded reports of quarter size hail in Gothenburg, estimated 60 MPH winds with tree limbs down in Cozad and a measured 56 MPH gust at the Lexington airport. However, this storm complex soon weakened below severe thresholds as it tracked deeper into the local area, and although isolated to scattered storms persisted across various parts of South Central Nebraska until around 5 a.m. CDT on the 29th there were no additional severe weather reports. Rainfall-wise, the vast majority of the area averaged well-under 1 inch, with some pockets of 1-2 concentrated mainly within Nuckolls/Thayer counties from round 1.||Given that this event consisted of different rounds of storms separated in both location and time, it should come as no surprise that the upper air and surface situation was somewhat complex. Starting with the mid-upper levels, forcing was respectable for mid-August as South Central Nebraska was positioned downstream from a broad, slow-moving trough edging from the Northern Rockies toward the Dakotas. Embedded within this mean trough were several smaller-scale shortwaves, each helping to drive the separate rounds of convection. At the surface, a very slow-moving/weak cold front gradually worked its way southeastward through South Central Nebraska during the evening/overnight. Digging a bit deeper, round 1 during the early evening was largely driven by weak convergence and considerable instability focused along a pre-frontal surface trough stretched from southwest KS into southeast NE. Despite fairly weak deep-layer wind shear only around 30 knots, these storms quickly became severe in an environment featuring at least 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and surface dewpoints well into the low-mid 70s F. The second round of storms that arrived later in the night initially developed during the evening well to the west over the High Plains and was tied more closely to the primary mid level vort max approaching from WY and also the actual surface cold front. Even at this late hour, round 2 still had up to around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE to work with.",There were six to eight inch diameter tree limbs blown down from estimated 60 mph thunderstorm wind gusts.,CSV

In an ironic twist, leading up to this event the southern Adams/northern Webster locale had been one of the driest places in the entire state of Nebraska for the summer, having recently been placed in a Severe Drought (D2) category by the U.S. Drought Monitor. As a striking example of this sudden transition from drought to flood, the NWS cooperative observer near Blue Hill tallied merely 2.77 of rain from Jun 1-Aug 27 (roughly 25% of normal) and then received more than twice this amount (6.62) on this single night! ||Taking a closer look at event timing and evolution, things got underway between 9:30-10:30 p.m. CDT on the 28th as thunderstorms erupted along a northwest-southeast axis extending from western Adams County down into Republic/Washington counties in Kansas.

Unlike the previous event, during which the axis of heaviest rain fell almost directly over the Solomon basin (including in the city of Osborne), this time around the instigating heavy rain fell in a west-east oriented swath about 10 miles farther south as a multicell storm cluster remained quasi-stationary for nearly three hours from 6-9 p.m. CDT on Tuesday the 30th. Radar rainfall estimation suggested that the heart of this narrow swath across central Osborne County averaged 1.50-3.00. However, a trained spotter near Covert happened to live within a very small (likely no more than a few square miles) bullseye of heaviest rain and reported an unofficial total of 5.50 inches along with water over some rural roads. While most of these initial, short-term areal flooding issues improved during the overnight hours, considerable runoff flowed down smaller streams such as Covert Creek and Kill Creek and eventually into the South Fork Solomon River, where the gauge at Osborne breached minor flood stage of 14 feet around 7 a.m. CDT on Wednesday the 31st. The river crested at 16.7 ft. during the afternoon (2.7 ft. above flood stage) and fell back below flood stage around 10 p.m. CDT. ||The isolated to scattered, slow-moving heavy rain storms that roamed North Central Kansas on both the 30th and 31st occurred in a classic weather pattern for localized/spotty heavy rain and flash flooding largely driven by diurnal heating. In the mid-upper levels, flow was very weak (especially near/below 500 millibars) with broad ridging in place, although weak, transient mid level disturbances were evident in the flow.

Already by noon CDT, strong thunderstorms were underway in Phillips County along a cold front advancing southeast through the region. Over the course of the next few hours convection increased in coverage and intensity as it marched across most of North Central Kansas, primarily producing sporadic wind damage and brief, torrential rainfall. Along the way, a few of the more notable storm reports included: estimated 70 MPH winds south of Alton accompanied by nickel size hail and over 2 of rain in a short time leading to localized flash flooding; measured severe-criteria wind gusts of 78 MPH in Beloit, 63 MPH at Simpson and 60 MPH near Jewell. Between 3-4 p.m. CDT, the main batch of strong to severe storms steadily departed the local area to the east and southeast, ending the severe weather threat for the day. Shortly thereafter, additional storms briefly flared up over Mitchell County but produced only heavy rain, and the entire six-county area was storm-free for the day by 6:30 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, the majority of this North Central Kansas area tallied between 0.50-2.00, with slightly higher amounts focused within southwestern Phillips, central Osborne and southern and eastern Mitchell counties, where brief flooding issues were most prevalent. ||By mid-August standards, the surface cold front that sparked this event was reasonably-strong, featuring gusty north winds in its wake and steadily-falling dewpoints. Just ahead of the front during the early-mid afternoon, surface temperatures climbed into the 80s F with dewpoints into the mid-upper 60s, fostering appreciable mixed-layer CAPE of at least 2000 J/kg. Deep layer wind shear was fairly modest at around 30 knots, resulting in a predominant multicell/quasi-linear storm mode.

While most places tallied only 0.50-1.50 in total, a rather narrow, southwest-northeast swath centered through western/northern Osborne County into far southwestern Jewell County picked up higher amounts into the 2.00-3.50 range, resulting in both short-term areal flooding and also minor flooding along the South Fork Solomon River from near Alton downstream through the Osborne area. Officially, 18-24 hour rainfall totals featured 3.21 at a Kansas Mesonet site on the north side of Osborne and 2.95 at an Osborne CoCoRaHS station. This was almost entirely a heavy rain event, with only one report of nickel size hail between Osborne and Downs shortly before 1 p.m. CDT. ||The first round of rain (round 1) was by far the most significant and occurred mainly between the mid-morning and early afternoon hours. A slow-moving multicell storm cluster initially flared up over western Osborne County between 11 a.m. and noon CDT, then drifted through northern Osborne County into Jewell County before weakening and eventually departing the local area between 2-3 p.m. CDT. This round 1 dumped generally 1.50 to 3 over the heart of this swath, including 2.50 at the Kansas Mesonet site in Osborne (1.77 of which fell in 45 minutes) and an unofficial public report of 3.5 south of Alton. As a result, fairly significant short term flooding (including street flooding) ensued during the early afternoon. While most of this initial flooding abated within a few hours, enough runoff eventually drained into the South Fork Solomon River to push the automated gauge at Osborne above its minor flood stage of 14 feet by 7 p.m. CDT. Although not as impactful as round 1, another batch of light to moderate rain blossomed across nearly all of North Central Kansas mainly between 1-6 a.m. CDT on the 25th, leaving behind another widespread 0.50-1.00, including 0.70 at the Kansas Mesonet site in Osborne. If nothing else, round 2 kept the South Fork Solomon River above flood stage a bit longer, as the Osborne gauge crested at 15.8 feet (1.8 ft. above flood stage) at 12:45 a.m. CDT on the 25th but didn't drop below flood stage until 12 hours later. ||Briefly looking at the meteorological background of this small-scale flooding event, the Central Plains was under a seasonably-active southwesterly flow regime in the mid-upper levels as a series of low-amplitude disturbances streamed overhead, well to the south of a parent low centered in far south central Canada.

The first thunderstorms began forming just after 3 pm and were part of a broken line of isolated storms that extended from O'neill south to near Kearney, and then southwest into Kansas. A dominant storm developed along the Hall-Howard County line by 4 p.m.. This storm became severe as it continued east, affecting adjoining portions of Hamilton and Merrick Counties through 5:30 pm CST. Around 4:50 pm CST, this storm produced a gustnado near Chapman, along with hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter, and estimated winds around 70 mph. After 5:30 pm, other storms developed in close-proximity, displaying multicell characteristics. An east-west oriented line segment of storms formed across Hamilton and York Counties. This line remained intact until 8 p.m. CST. Storms within this line trained, producing severe hail up to the size of golf balls and flash flooding from several inches of rain. Outflow winds overturned an irrigation pivot and produced blowing dust that reduced the visibility to near zero near Bradshaw. Several reports of gustnadoes were received along the leading edge of the outflow. ||Meanwhile, one storm crossed into Furnas County from Kansas beginning around 4 p.m. CST. Several other thunderstorms developed around it, forming a small mostly sub-severe cluster. The initial storm briefly became severe, producing estimated winds of 85 mph in northern Furnas County. This cluster moved northeast and eventually formed a short line segment that was oriented from northwest to southeast. This line produced winds of 50 to 55 mph in a couple locations in Adams and Clay Counties. It then crossed Hall, Hamilton, and York Counties from 7 to 9 p.m. CST, adding to the already impressive rainfall amounts. Much of northeastern Hamilton County received 4 to 6 inches of rain in less than 6 hours. The highest total was 6.77 inches at Marquette. These high rainfall amounts were surrounded by a larger area of 2 to 3 inches which extended across Hall, Hamilton, and York Counties. This rain resulted in extensive flooding over northeastern Hamilton County and along the Big Blue River in Polk County.||Occluding low pressure was along the Montana-North Dakota border on this day. The triple point was over South Dakota, with a quasi-stationary warm front extending east through the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic States. The cold front was advancing eastward across Nebraska, and was moving through south central Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours. In the upper levels, a broad trough covered much of the Unites States, anchored by an intensifying upper-low over Montana. A closed high was over Ontario, Canada. Temperatures in the pre-storm environment climbed to around 80 degrees, with dewpoints in the middle to upper 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor resulting in MLCAPE of not more than 1500 J/kg.

Convection continuously redeveloped and streamed along a north-south oriented corridor for several more hours, even past sunrise, before the final morning storms finally vacated South Central Nebraska between 9:30-10:30 a.m. CDT.  While most morning storms produced only small hail and locally heavy rain up to around 2���, the presence of modest most-unstable CAPE of at least 500 J/kg resulted in a few strong to marginally severe cells, including one that dumped hail up to ping pong ball size on Aurora around 3:30 a.m. CDT. ||The vast majority of South Central Nebraska had a storm-free lull between late morning and mid-afternoon before the next round of surface-based convection initiated between 3-4 p.m. CDT over Nuckolls, Clay and Hamilton counties along a slow-moving cold front.

These storms resulted in a handful of large hail and heavy rain reports, highlighted by stones up to 2��� diameter in Bruning during the afternoon and an unofficial calendar-day rainfall total of 4.70��� in Milligan. ||Starting with the initial early morning round, scattered to numerous elevated storms blossomed within counties east of the Highway 281 corridor between 1-3 a.m. CDT, forming in rather classic nocturnal fashion along the axis of a stout 50 knot southerly low level jet evident at 850 millibars. Convection continuously redeveloped and streamed along a north-south oriented corridor for several more hours, even past sunrise, before the final morning storms finally vacated South Central Nebraska between 9:30-10:30 a.m. CDT.  While most morning storms produced only small hail and locally heavy rain up to around 2���, the presence of modest most-unstable CAPE of at least 500 J/kg resulted in a few strong to marginally severe cells, including one that dumped hail up to ping pong ball size on Aurora around 3:30 a.m. CDT. ||The vast majority of South Central Nebraska had a storm-free lull between late morning and mid-afternoon before the next round of surface-based convection initiated between 3-4 p.m. CDT over Nuckolls, Clay and Hamilton counties along a slow-moving cold front. During the ensuing three hours from 4-7 p.m. CDT, a north-south axis of mainly multicell and quasi-linear storms edged slowly east, primarily affecting the Highway 81 counties before exiting into eastern Nebraska around sunset. The most intense storm of the afternoon tracked through northern Thayer and southern Fillmore counties between 4:30-6:00 p.m. CDT, yielding several reports of quarter to golf ball size hail in the Carleton and Bruning areas, including a few stones up to 2��� in Bruning. Rainfall-wise, these storms dumped generally 1-2��� over some of the same eastern real estate that already saw similar amounts during the morning. As a result, localized pockets of the area tallied 3+��� for the calendar day, although there were no reports of significant flooding. A few of the highest reported daily rain totals featured: 4.70��� in Milligan, 4.05��� in Polk, 3.44��� near Carleton and 3.08��� in Bradshaw. ||Taking a closer look at the meteorological setup for the afternoon round, this was a fairly strongly-forced event in the mid-upper levels, as a potent shortwave trough swung out of CO into the heart of the Central Plains. At the surface, a rather well-defined and slow-moving, north-south oriented cold front provided a focus for storm initiation in eastern counties. Despite surface dewpoints along/ahead of the front rising into the low-mid 60s F, considerable daytime cloud cover helped hold down mixed-layer CAPE over the local area, with generally no more than 1000 J/kg. However, both deep-layer wind shear (around 50 knots) and low-level wind shear (around 30 knots) were rather strong, compensating somewhat for the lack of instability. On the regional scale, South Central Nebraska narrowly missed out on a more widespread severe storm event that impacted parts of central and eastern KS.",Hail ranging in size from nickels to ping pong balls was reported.,CSV

In reality, the official convective and non-convective storm/damage reports documented here only capture a portion of all significant weather/damages observed within South Central Nebraska. ||Focusing more detail on the thunderstorms and tornadoes, the culprit was a narrow, strongly forced squall line that steadily advanced across the entire local area from west-southwest to east-northeast.

These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon.

At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH.

At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence.

Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered far southwestern local counties such as Furnas/Gosper between 10:30-11:30 AM, swept through central areas including the Tri Cities between 12 PM and 1:30 PM and eventually exited far northeastern counties such as Polk/Nance between 2-3 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon. A few of the most significant damage reports not directly attributed to tornadic circulations included: construction trailers blown over and a barn destroyed on the west side of Kearney; and machine shed and tree damage southeast of Bruning. ||Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for many places the worst was yet to come in the form of the widespread evening damaging wind event, which largely unfolded under clear skies due to strong subsidence on the backside of an intense low pressure system. At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH. Timing-wise, high winds rapidly overspread most of South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast, with severe-criteria gusts first measured in counties such as Furnas/Harlan shortly after 5 PM, central locations such as Grand Island/Hastings between 6-7 PM and far northern counties such as Valley by 8 PM. Finally, between 9:30 and 10:30 PM, winds eased below High Wind Warning criteria for the night. Based on dozens of reports from automated sensors, only the southeastern fringe of South Central Nebraska (generally southeast of a Red Cloud-Geneva line) was spared widespread damaging winds. Meanwhile, across the rest of the area, just a sampling of peak measured wind gusts included: 76 MPH at Aurora airport, 75 MPH at Grand Island airport and near Oxford, 73 MPH near Franklin, 72 MPH in Osceola and 71 MPH at the NWS office in Hastings. Needless to say, these evening winds resulted in fairly widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. Forecast-wise, while gusty winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of this event exceeded expectations.||Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in South Central Nebraska than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence.

Then, isolated storms developed in the afternoon and produced severe hail. During the evening hours Tuesday, a mature squall line developed over the Sandhills. It propagated southeast and into the region beginning around 11:30 p.m. CST. The squall line was at peak intensity as it entered Dawson, Howard, and Valley Counties. It rapidly weakened after 12:30 a.m. CST. However, the remnant outflow continued to produce strong to severe winds through 3 a.m. CST, well after the deep convection had dissipated. Widespread winds between 50 and 60 mph were measured, but peak wind gusts included 61 mph at Grand Island, 63 mph near Oxford, 64 mph at Lexington, and 76 mph at Edison. Tree damage was reported in several locations, with trees blown over and tree limbs snapped off. The last strong wind gust measured was 56 mph at York, at 3:03 a.m. CST. Isolated power outages occurred across the region.||Later in the afternoon, a small cluster of multicell thunderstorms developed over the Sandhills. A few isolated storms managed to develop along the southwest flank of its outflow boundary, though most of them were weak, short-lived, and sub-severe. A single-cell storm, which exhibited multi-cell characteristics at times, dominated the other cells over Custer County. Just after 7 p.m. CST, this storm moved into northwest Buffalo County and produced a few reports of dime to quarter size hail. By 8 p.m. CST, the storm began weakening and then rapidly dissipated over southwest Buffalo County.||The surface map was complex. The thunderstorms that initially spawned the squall line developed between two fronts. A stationary front extended west from the mid-Atlantic region, through the mid-Mississippi Valley into Oklahoma, then northwest into western Kansas and Nebraska. A weak cold front extended from Lake Superior to the northwest tip of Nebraska into Wyoming and Idaho. The afternoon storms formed behind this front which was surging southward. It was located along the Nebraska-Kansas state line by 6 p.m. CST. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were fairly zonal over the northern third of the U.S., with subtropical highs over the Southwest and off the Carolina Coast. A weak shortwave trough was embedded in the Westerlies over the Dakota's Tuesday evening. By Wednesday evening, it had progressed into Minnesota and Iowa, with some slight amplification and more of a cyclonic look between the two highs. Just prior to the arrival of the squall line, surface temperatures were in the upper 60s to lower 70s, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were steep, between 7.5 and 7.9 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. Effectively deep layer shear was less than 25 kts. The MCS was moving out of an area of more favorable shear, resulting in the shear within the cold pool becoming dominant, and the demise of the deep convection. With the isolated hail producer later that evening, temperatures behind the front were in the lower 80s, with dewpoints still in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were moist adiabatic.

Thanks to daytime high temperatures topping out 32-34 degrees, some snow melted as it fell, with the most efficient accumulations holding off until late in the day/evening.

Between midnight and 1 a.m. CST, small, isolated single-cell thunderstorms developed over central Nebraska, between Ainsworth and Lexington. As the night progressed, they were joined by more storms with an increasing trend toward a multicell convective mode as a common cold pool formed. The southern end of the developing MCS drifted eastward into Valley and Sherman Counties, with the deep convection on the west side of the MCS remaining quasi-stationary. After 6 a.m. CST, the northern portion of the MCS (over the Sandhills) weakened while the southern portion became dominant. By 6:30 a.m. CST, the dominant storms evolved into a short east-west oriented squall line across Sherman and Howard Counties. This line subsequently dropped southeast across Hall between 7 and 8 a.m. CST, then continued all the way down to Hebron, exiting south central Nebraska a little after 10 a.m. CST. Cell training produced a north-northwest to south-southeast oriented swath of 3 to 5 inches of rain across Valley, Sherman, and Howard Counties. Minor flash flooding resulted in water covering roads in some areas.

Between midnight and 1 a.m. CST, small, isolated single-cell thunderstorms developed over central Nebraska, between Ainsworth and Lexington. As the night progressed, they were joined by more storms with an increasing trend toward a multicell convective mode as a common cold pool formed. The southern end of the developing MCS drifted eastward into Valley and Sherman Counties, with the deep convection on the west side of the MCS remaining quasi-stationary. After 6 a.m. CST, the northern portion of the MCS (over the Sandhills) weakened while the southern portion became dominant. By 6:30 a.m. CST, the dominant storms evolved into a short east-west oriented squall line across Sherman and Howard Counties. This line subsequently dropped southeast across Hall between 7 and 8 a.m. CST, then continued all the way down to Hebron, exiting south central Nebraska a little after 10 a.m. CST. Cell training produced a north-northwest to south-southeast oriented swath of 3 to 5 inches of rain across Valley, Sherman, and Howard Counties. Minor flash flooding resulted in water covering roads in some areas. As the storms tracked across Hall and northern Adams Counties, some low-end severe hail (dime to quarter size) occurred in a few spots. The most significant report of severe weather was a blown over tractor-trailer near the Interstate 80 interchange at Alda.||This MCS developed far from any fronts, but on the eastern edge of a tongue of higher theta-e air in the lower levels, in the presence of warm air advection and deep convergence. A 25-30 kt low level jet over and just west of the genesis region. The front that moved through the region, on Wednesday the 27th, was quasi-stationary from the Ohio Valley southwest to Oklahoma, with its western extent banked up against the Rockies in Colorado and Wyoming. High pressure encompassed much of the north central and northeast U.S. These elevated thunderstorms developed in a regime in which surface temperatures were in the lower to middle 60s, with dewpoints in the upper 50s to lower 60s. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were weak and covered the northern half of the U.S. They were fairly zonal in character, but did exhibit a slight ridge over the Northern Rockies, with a pair of weak shortwave troughs moving through the mid-Mississippi Valley and Nebraska and Kansas. This MCS occurred along the eastern fringe of a tight instability gradient in which MUCAPE was between 500 and 900 J/kg. Mid-level lapse rates were moist adiabatic. Effective deep layer shear was between 35 and 45 kts.","Wind gusts were estimated to be 60 MPH.

Numerous other single cell storms then developed across Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell Counties, with cell mergers eventually resulting in a large cluster of storms that propagated east across Osborne and Mitchell Counties. Two to four inches of rain fell across Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell Counties, mostly within a 2-hour period. The highest rainfall reported was 3.85 inches in Osborne. One storm did produce hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter just north of Stockton. That was the only severe weather reported, but winds were measured at 56 mph in rural Mitchell County, a few miles east of Tipton.||At sunset Saturday evening, a quasi-stationary front was oriented east-to-west from the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley through the mid-Mississippi Valley to near the Kansas-Oklahoma border. Its western extent was banked up against the Rockies. A low pressure system was over Montana. As the low continued to mature, the front began lifting north as a warm front. These storms formed on the cool side of the surface front and by daybreak Sunday, the front extended from northwest-to-southeast across Kansas. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were over the northern half of the U.S. and were characterized by low amplitude. A slight ridge was over the Northern Rockies, with a slight trough over the Midwest and Great Lakes. A low was over southwest Canada, with a shortwave trough moving into the Pacific Northwest.

Fortunately, no structural damage or injuries were reported.||This fire ignited around 1 PM in a rural area of far south central Valley County, a short distance southeast of the intersection of Nebraska Highways 22 and 70. Unfortunately, weather conditions were ripe for rapid fire spread and growth. Although relative humidity (RH) values averaged around 30% (slightly above official critical values), very strong northwest winds whipped the flames through dry grasses, with sustained speeds generally 25-35 MPH and frequent gusts to around 45 MPH. It didn't take long for the fire to jump over the county line into far northern Sherman County. Given that it was tracking toward the north side of Sherman Reservoir, several residences in the area were evacuated as a precaution. Fortunately, the fire was brought under control north of the reservoir by early evening before affecting any structures, thanks to the efforts of 13 rural fire departments and even one fire-fighting aircraft. This fire ended up consuming roughly 6,000 acres of dormant pasture and farm land as it traveled a relatively narrow, northwest-to-southeast path of 6-7 miles. On a side note, while only a small fraction of South Central Nebraska was directly impacted by this fire, a highly-visible and locally-thick smoke plume drifted at least 50-100 miles southeast during the afternoon, briefly reducing visibilities in many places, including the Hastings area.",,CSV

Fortunately, no structural damage or injuries were reported.||This fire ignited around 1 PM in a rural area of far south central Valley County, a short distance southeast of the intersection of Nebraska Highways 22 and 70. Unfortunately, weather conditions were ripe for rapid fire spread and growth. Although relative humidity (RH) values averaged around 30% (slightly above official critical values), very strong northwest winds whipped the flames through dry grasses, with sustained speeds generally 25-35 MPH and frequent gusts to around 45 MPH. It didn't take long for the fire to jump over the county line into far northern Sherman County. Given that it was tracking toward the north side of Sherman Reservoir, several residences in the area were evacuated as a precaution. Fortunately, the fire was brought under control north of the reservoir by early evening before affecting any structures, thanks to the efforts of 13 rural fire departments and even one fire-fighting aircraft. This fire ended up consuming roughly 6,000 acres of dormant pasture and farm land as it traveled a relatively narrow, northwest-to-southeast path of 6-7 miles. On a side note, while only a small fraction of South Central Nebraska was directly impacted by this fire, a highly-visible and locally-thick smoke plume drifted at least 50-100 miles southeast during the afternoon, briefly reducing visibilities in many places, including the Hastings area.",,CSV

Numerous thunderstorms then fired in a southwest-northeast line across north central Kansas into eastern Nebraska around 11 p.m. CST, including isolated cells developing ahead of the line. This line formed across Rooks, Osborne, Mitchell, and Jewell Counties. These storms migrated out of these Counties by 1 a.m. CST. One of the embedded storms tracked across northern Mitchell County and produced hail up to the size of quarters from Beloit down to near Simpson.||A very weak, slow-moving cold front was advancing through north central Kansas. These storms developed along and just behind the front. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were zonal, with a slight trough from the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Plains, and a slight ridge over the Great Lakes. A closed, baroclinic low was over southern Canada, just north of North Dakota. Just prior to widespread thunderstorm initiation, temperatures remained very warm, in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. With mid-level lapse rates around 7.5 degrees C/km, MLCAPE was slightly more than 3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 35 kts right along the front.",,CSV

A couple small areas of thunderstorm activity were ongoing over the Nebraska panhandle during the morning. Between 10 a.m. and noon CST, a short squall-line (roughly 2 counties wide) developed and was moving through northeast Colorado and southwest Nebraska. It continued southeastward and entered north central Kansas a little after 3 p.m. CST. In the preceding 30 minutes, it had taken on a bow shape. This bow echo raked north central Kansas between 3 and 5:30 p.m. CST. The apex of the bow tracked across southern Phillips County, along the Smith-Osborne County line into northern Mitchell County. This is where the most intense winds and damage occurred. Winds were measured between 50 and 62 mph along its entire path, with a peak gusts of 68 mph in Beloit and 71 mph at Smith Center. Blown down trees and snapped off branches were reported in a few spots, and a roof was blown off part of a business in Phillipsburg.||The initial storms developed in upslope flow behind a weak cold front that had passed through the area the previous evening. By the time the storms were affecting north central Kansas, the front was along the Kansas-Oklahoma border, and weak high moved into Nebraska. In the upper levels, a broad trough extended across the north central and northeast U.S., while a low amplitude subtropical high was over the West. A weak shortwave trough was over Montana and Wyoming at 6 a.m. CST. By early evening, it had migrated into Minnesota, northwest Iowa, and Nebraska. The pre-convective environment was characterized by temperatures in the 80s, with dewpoints in the upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, resulting in modest MLCAPE of only 900 to 1400 J/kg, and MUCAPE was not much higher. Effectively deep layer shear was around 35 kts.",This peak gust was measured on the backside of the storm. Tree damage was reported in Smith Center.,CSV

While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon.

The first thunderstorms began forming just after 3 pm and were part of a broken line of isolated storms that extended from O'neill south to near Kearney, and then southwest into Kansas. A dominant storm developed along the Hall-Howard County line by 4 p.m.. This storm became severe as it continued east, affecting adjoining portions of Hamilton and Merrick Counties through 5:30 pm CST. Around 4:50 pm CST, this storm produced a gustnado near Chapman, along with hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter, and estimated winds around 70 mph. After 5:30 pm, other storms developed in close-proximity, displaying multicell characteristics. An east-west oriented line segment of storms formed across Hamilton and York Counties. This line remained intact until 8 p.m. CST. Storms within this line trained, producing severe hail up to the size of golf balls and flash flooding from several inches of rain. Outflow winds overturned an irrigation pivot and produced blowing dust that reduced the visibility to near zero near Bradshaw. Several reports of gustnadoes were received along the leading edge of the outflow. ||Meanwhile, one storm crossed into Furnas County from Kansas beginning around 4 p.m. CST. Several other thunderstorms developed around it, forming a small mostly sub-severe cluster. The initial storm briefly became severe, producing estimated winds of 85 mph in northern Furnas County. This cluster moved northeast and eventually formed a short line segment that was oriented from northwest to southeast. This line produced winds of 50 to 55 mph in a couple locations in Adams and Clay Counties. It then crossed Hall, Hamilton, and York Counties from 7 to 9 p.m. CST, adding to the already impressive rainfall amounts. Much of northeastern Hamilton County received 4 to 6 inches of rain in less than 6 hours. The highest total was 6.77 inches at Marquette.

While past Christmases (such as 2009) are remembered for more traditional significant winter weather such as heavy snow/blizzards, this one will go down in the record books for spring-like severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and the first three December tornadoes in Nebraska since 1975, followed by an intense damaging wind event during the evening hours featuring sustained values of 30-50 MPH and peak gusts generally 55-75 MPH. All things considered, the evening high winds were actually more impactful to the area as a whole than the daytime thunderstorms, given that fierce speeds persisted as long as two to three hours in most locations. These winds resulted in widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines (promoting several power outages) and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. In reality, the official convective and non-convective storm/damage reports documented here only capture a portion of all significant weather/damages observed within South Central Nebraska. ||Focusing more detail on the thunderstorms and tornadoes, the culprit was a narrow, strongly forced squall line that steadily advanced across the entire local area from west-southwest to east-northeast. Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered far southwestern local counties such as Furnas/Gosper between 10:30-11:30 AM, swept through central areas including the Tri Cities between 12 PM and 1:30 PM and eventually exited far northeastern counties such as Polk/Nance between 2-3 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon. A few of the most significant damage reports not directly attributed to tornadic circulations included: construction trailers blown over and a barn destroyed on the west side of Kearney; and machine shed and tree damage southeast of Bruning. ||Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for many places the worst was yet to come in the form of the widespread evening damaging wind event, which largely unfolded under clear skies due to strong subsidence on the backside of an intense low pressure system. At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH. Timing-wise, high winds rapidly overspread most of South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast, with severe-criteria gusts first measured in counties such as Furnas/Harlan shortly after 5 PM, central locations such as Grand Island/Hastings between 6-7 PM and far northern counties such as Valley by 8 PM. Finally, between 9:30 and 10:30 PM, winds eased below High Wind Warning criteria for the night. Based on dozens of reports from automated sensors, only the southeastern fringe of South Central Nebraska (generally southeast of a Red Cloud-Geneva line) was spared widespread damaging winds. Meanwhile, across the rest of the area, just a sampling of peak measured wind gusts included: 76 MPH at Aurora airport, 75 MPH at Grand Island airport and near Oxford, 73 MPH near Franklin, 72 MPH in Osceola and 71 MPH at the NWS office in Hastings. Needless to say, these evening winds resulted in fairly widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. Forecast-wise, while gusty winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of this event exceeded expectations.||Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in South Central Nebraska than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.","The highest wind gust of 73 mph was measured at 5:48 p.m. by a mesonet site 2 miles north of Franklin. Other wind gusts included 66 mph at Hildreth, 65 mph seven miles south-southeast of Wilcox and 64 mph three miles south-southwest of Naponee. A 30 to 35 foot tower on top of the four-story court house in Franklin was blown down sometime around 6 p.m. Strong sustained winds around 40 MPH or higher continued for a few hours across the area.",CSV

While past Christmases (such as 2009) are remembered for more traditional significant winter weather such as heavy snow/blizzards, this one will go down in the record books for spring-like severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and the first three December tornadoes in Nebraska since 1975, followed by an intense damaging wind event during the evening hours featuring sustained values of 30-50 MPH and peak gusts generally 55-75 MPH. All things considered, the evening high winds were actually more impactful to the area as a whole than the daytime thunderstorms, given that fierce speeds persisted as long as two to three hours in most locations. These winds resulted in widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines (promoting several power outages) and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. In reality, the official convective and non-convective storm/damage reports documented here only capture a portion of all significant weather/damages observed within South Central Nebraska. ||Focusing more detail on the thunderstorms and tornadoes, the culprit was a narrow, strongly forced squall line that steadily advanced across the entire local area from west-southwest to east-northeast. Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered far southwestern local counties such as Furnas/Gosper between 10:30-11:30 AM, swept through central areas including the Tri Cities between 12 PM and 1:30 PM and eventually exited far northeastern counties such as Polk/Nance between 2-3 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon. A few of the most significant damage reports not directly attributed to tornadic circulations included: construction trailers blown over and a barn destroyed on the west side of Kearney; and machine shed and tree damage southeast of Bruning. ||Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for many places the worst was yet to come in the form of the widespread evening damaging wind event, which largely unfolded under clear skies due to strong subsidence on the backside of an intense low pressure system. At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH. Timing-wise, high winds rapidly overspread most of South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast, with severe-criteria gusts first measured in counties such as Furnas/Harlan shortly after 5 PM, central locations such as Grand Island/Hastings between 6-7 PM and far northern counties such as Valley by 8 PM. Finally, between 9:30 and 10:30 PM, winds eased below High Wind Warning criteria for the night. Based on dozens of reports from automated sensors, only the southeastern fringe of South Central Nebraska (generally southeast of a Red Cloud-Geneva line) was spared widespread damaging winds. Meanwhile, across the rest of the area, just a sampling of peak measured wind gusts included: 76 MPH at Aurora airport, 75 MPH at Grand Island airport and near Oxford, 73 MPH near Franklin, 72 MPH in Osceola and 71 MPH at the NWS office in Hastings. Needless to say, these evening winds resulted in fairly widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. Forecast-wise, while gusty winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of this event exceeded expectations.||Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in South Central Nebraska than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.","Based on observations from neighboring counties such as Hall and Hamilton, a significant high wind event impacted Merrick County for over two hours, likely featuring peak gusts of generally 60-75 MPH and sustained speeds 40-50 MPH.",CSV

A couple small areas of thunderstorm activity were ongoing over the Nebraska panhandle during the morning. Between 10 a.m. and noon CST, a short squall-line (roughly 2 counties wide) developed and was moving through northeast Colorado and southwest Nebraska. It continued southeastward and entered north central Kansas a little after 3 p.m. CST. In the preceding 30 minutes, it had taken on a bow shape. This bow echo raked north central Kansas between 3 and 5:30 p.m. CST. The apex of the bow tracked across southern Phillips County, along the Smith-Osborne County line into northern Mitchell County. This is where the most intense winds and damage occurred. Winds were measured between 50 and 62 mph along its entire path, with a peak gusts of 68 mph in Beloit and 71 mph at Smith Center. Blown down trees and snapped off branches were reported in a few spots, and a roof was blown off part of a business in Phillipsburg.||The initial storms developed in upslope flow behind a weak cold front that had passed through the area the previous evening. By the time the storms were affecting north central Kansas, the front was along the Kansas-Oklahoma border, and weak high moved into Nebraska. In the upper levels, a broad trough extended across the north central and northeast U.S., while a low amplitude subtropical high was over the West. A weak shortwave trough was over Montana and Wyoming at 6 a.m. CST. By early evening, it had migrated into Minnesota, northwest Iowa, and Nebraska. The pre-convective environment was characterized by temperatures in the 80s, with dewpoints in the upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, resulting in modest MLCAPE of only 900 to 1400 J/kg, and MUCAPE was not much higher. Effectively deep layer shear was around 35 kts.","Wind gust estimates of 60 to 70 MPH were reported, with the AWOS at the Smith Center Airport measuring a peak gust of 71 MPH.

While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon.

No additional severe weather was reported with these storms once they left Gosper and Furnas Counties. However, around 4:30 p.m. CST, new storms formed over Adams County. Multicell development resulted in storms expanding into a cluster that enveloped northern Adams and southern Hall Counties. This cluster of storms eventually tracked northeast all the way to Columbus, affecting Hamilton, Howard, Merrick, Nance, and Polk Counties. These storms produced multiple reports of severe hail, the largest of which was the size of ping pong balls near Hordville, in northeast Hamilton County. Snapped off branches and trees were blown down in portions of St. Paul and Grand Island. A semi trailer was also blown over on Highway 81 in Polk County.||At dawn, a quasi-stationary front extended from the Ohio Valley through Missouri, turning northwest into Kansas and Nebraska. This front lifted northeast as a warm front and was east of Nebraska by midday. A very weak cold front was sagging southward through the Northern Plains. This front entered northern Nebraska during the afternoon and extended roughly along I-80 from west to east by mid-evening. The upper levels were characterized by zonal flow, with a very slight trough over the Pacific Northwest and a slight ridge over the Great Lakes. Despite Nebraska being just south of the Westerlies, a weak/subtle shortwave trough was moving through.

While past Christmases (such as 2009) are remembered for more traditional significant winter weather such as heavy snow/blizzards, this one will go down in the record books for spring-like severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and the first three December tornadoes in Nebraska since 1975, followed by an intense damaging wind event during the evening hours featuring sustained values of 30-50 MPH and peak gusts generally 55-75 MPH. All things considered, the evening high winds were actually more impactful to the area as a whole than the daytime thunderstorms, given that fierce speeds persisted as long as two to three hours in most locations. These winds resulted in widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines (promoting several power outages) and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. In reality, the official convective and non-convective storm/damage reports documented here only capture a portion of all significant weather/damages observed within South Central Nebraska. ||Focusing more detail on the thunderstorms and tornadoes, the culprit was a narrow, strongly forced squall line that steadily advanced across the entire local area from west-southwest to east-northeast. Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered far southwestern local counties such as Furnas/Gosper between 10:30-11:30 AM, swept through central areas including the Tri Cities between 12 PM and 1:30 PM and eventually exited far northeastern counties such as Polk/Nance between 2-3 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon. A few of the most significant damage reports not directly attributed to tornadic circulations included: construction trailers blown over and a barn destroyed on the west side of Kearney; and machine shed and tree damage southeast of Bruning. ||Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for many places the worst was yet to come in the form of the widespread evening damaging wind event, which largely unfolded under clear skies due to strong subsidence on the backside of an intense low pressure system. At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH. Timing-wise, high winds rapidly overspread most of South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast, with severe-criteria gusts first measured in counties such as Furnas/Harlan shortly after 5 PM, central locations such as Grand Island/Hastings between 6-7 PM and far northern counties such as Valley by 8 PM. Finally, between 9:30 and 10:30 PM, winds eased below High Wind Warning criteria for the night. Based on dozens of reports from automated sensors, only the southeastern fringe of South Central Nebraska (generally southeast of a Red Cloud-Geneva line) was spared widespread damaging winds. Meanwhile, across the rest of the area, just a sampling of peak measured wind gusts included: 76 MPH at Aurora airport, 75 MPH at Grand Island airport and near Oxford, 73 MPH near Franklin, 72 MPH in Osceola and 71 MPH at the NWS office in Hastings. Needless to say, these evening winds resulted in fairly widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. Forecast-wise, while gusty winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of this event exceeded expectations.||Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in South Central Nebraska than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.","The highest wind gust of 73 mph was measured at 6:01 p.m. by a mesonet site 1 mile northeast of Juniata. Other wind gusts included 72 mph one mile west-northwest of Hastings, 71 mph at the NWS office four miles north of Hastings, 70 mph three miles south of Hastings, 65 mph two miles southwest of Roseland, 64 mph one mile south of Prosser and 63 mph at the Hastings airport ASOS. These winds resulted in roof and tree damage in portions of Hastings. Strong sustained winds around 40 MPH or higher continued for a few hours across the area.",CSV

This was the second year in a row in which a tornado touched down in south central Nebraska during the month of November. This was only the fourth time since 2000 that a tornado occurred in the state of Nebraska during the month of November. Additionally, this event marked the second latest calendar day in which tornadoes touched down in Nebraska. The latest was December 13, 1975, when tornadoes occurred in Thayer and Pawnee Counties. ||Low stratus enveloped the region on this day, with patches of light rain moving southwest to northeast from Kansas. The largest area of rain moved across all of south central Nebraska between 11 am and 3 pm CST. The passage of its back edge brought an end to the steady rain. Behind this area of rain, scattered convective showers began developing within the dry slot, where the stratus was beginning to break-up, between the cloudy area to the northeast and the clear area to the southwest. From 3 to 5 pm CST, a few showers evolved into thunderstorms. The storms that eventually produced the tornadoes began as showers over north central Kansas, between Norton and Hayes. These cells intensified after 3:30 pm CST, and became low-top mini-supercells. The first tornado was over northeast Franklin County, just after 4 pm CST. The other two tornadoes occurred between 4:30 pm and 5:05 pm over east-central Webster and northwest Nuckolls Counties, and they were on the ground for several minutes, each with path lengths around 4 miles. The Webster County tornado produced EF-1 damage. The other two tornadoes were EF-0. Both of those tornadoes occurred in areas with very few objects to damage. Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced nickel size hail in a couple spots within Dawson and Howard Counties. One inch hail also occurred with the storm that produced the EF-1 tornado, just east of Red Cloud.||An occluded low pressure system emerged from the lee side of the Rockies through the day. The primary low crossed southeast Montana into North Dakota, while the triple point low matured over northeast Colorado and deepened from 996 mb at 6 am CST to 985 mb by 6 pm, as it crossed the western part of Nebraska on its way to near O'Neill. The stratiform rain occurred north of the warm front which began the day along the southern Nebraska border. This front lifted north along with the triple point low. The low-top convection formed along and ahead of the cold front, within the warm sector. In the upper-levels, a deep trough was over the western U.S., with two embedded well-defined shortwave troughs. The lead trough was over Utah and Arizona at 6 am CST. It exhibited negative tilt and was associated with the severe weather. By 6 pm CST, this trough had nearly formed a closed mid-level low along the Nebraska-South Dakota border. At that time, this low was in the left exit region of a 150 kt jet streak at 300 mb. Even with the extensive cloud cover, warm air advection had propelled surface temperatures into the middle and upper 50s, with dewpoints in the middle 50s. Mid-level lapse rates increased as the dry slot moved in, with values as high as 7.5 deg C/km. This resulted in sufficient instability, with MUCAPE at least 500 J/kg, but not as high as 1000 J/kg. Very strong and veering low-level winds resulted in 0-1 km SRH between 400 and 500 m2/s2. SRH of that strength was able to overcome the weak instability to result in a Supercell Composite Index in excess of 4, and a 0-1 Energy-Helicity Index in excess of 1.","This tornado uprooted trees, destroyed an outbuilding, upset 2 irrigation pivots and caused other minor damage along its path.

This was the second year in a row in which a tornado touched down in south central Nebraska during the month of November. This was only the fourth time since 2000 that a tornado occurred in the state of Nebraska during the month of November. Additionally, this event marked the second latest calendar day in which tornadoes touched down in Nebraska. The latest was December 13, 1975, when tornadoes occurred in Thayer and Pawnee Counties. ||Low stratus enveloped the region on this day, with patches of light rain moving southwest to northeast from Kansas. The largest area of rain moved across all of south central Nebraska between 11 am and 3 pm CST. The passage of its back edge brought an end to the steady rain. Behind this area of rain, scattered convective showers began developing within the dry slot, where the stratus was beginning to break-up, between the cloudy area to the northeast and the clear area to the southwest. From 3 to 5 pm CST, a few showers evolved into thunderstorms. The storms that eventually produced the tornadoes began as showers over north central Kansas, between Norton and Hayes. These cells intensified after 3:30 pm CST, and became low-top mini-supercells. The first tornado was over northeast Franklin County, just after 4 pm CST. The other two tornadoes occurred between 4:30 pm and 5:05 pm over east-central Webster and northwest Nuckolls Counties, and they were on the ground for several minutes, each with path lengths around 4 miles. The Webster County tornado produced EF-1 damage. The other two tornadoes were EF-0. Both of those tornadoes occurred in areas with very few objects to damage. Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced nickel size hail in a couple spots within Dawson and Howard Counties. One inch hail also occurred with the storm that produced the EF-1 tornado, just east of Red Cloud.||An occluded low pressure system emerged from the lee side of the Rockies through the day. The primary low crossed southeast Montana into North Dakota, while the triple point low matured over northeast Colorado and deepened from 996 mb at 6 am CST to 985 mb by 6 pm, as it crossed the western part of Nebraska on its way to near O'Neill. The stratiform rain occurred north of the warm front which began the day along the southern Nebraska border. This front lifted north along with the triple point low. The low-top convection formed along and ahead of the cold front, within the warm sector. In the upper-levels, a deep trough was over the western U.S., with two embedded well-defined shortwave troughs. The lead trough was over Utah and Arizona at 6 am CST. It exhibited negative tilt and was associated with the severe weather. By 6 pm CST, this trough had nearly formed a closed mid-level low along the Nebraska-South Dakota border. At that time, this low was in the left exit region of a 150 kt jet streak at 300 mb. Even with the extensive cloud cover, warm air advection had propelled surface temperatures into the middle and upper 50s, with dewpoints in the middle 50s. Mid-level lapse rates increased as the dry slot moved in, with values as high as 7.5 deg C/km. This resulted in sufficient instability, with MUCAPE at least 500 J/kg, but not as high as 1000 J/kg. Very strong and veering low-level winds resulted in 0-1 km SRH between 400 and 500 m2/s2. SRH of that strength was able to overcome the weak instability to result in a Supercell Composite Index in excess of 4, and a 0-1 Energy-Helicity Index in excess of 1.",Hail was reported by a truck driver on Interstate 80 near mile marker 230.,CSV

The stratiform rain occurred north of the warm front which began the day along the southern Nebraska border. This front lifted north along with the triple point low. The low-top convection formed along and ahead of the cold front, within the warm sector. In the upper-levels, a deep trough was over the western U.S., with two embedded well-defined shortwave troughs. The lead trough was over Utah and Arizona at 6 am CST. It exhibited negative tilt and was associated with the severe weather. By 6 pm CST, this trough had nearly formed a closed mid-level low along the Nebraska-South Dakota border. At that time, this low was in the left exit region of a 150 kt jet streak at 300 mb. Even with the extensive cloud cover, warm air advection had propelled surface temperatures into the middle and upper 50s, with dewpoints in the middle 50s. Mid-level lapse rates increased as the dry slot moved in, with values as high as 7.5 deg C/km. This resulted in sufficient instability, with MUCAPE at least 500 J/kg, but not as high as 1000 J/kg. Very strong and veering low-level winds resulted in 0-1 km SRH between 400 and 500 m2/s2.

The supercell rapidly became tornadic, initially producing a  brief tornado touchdown (EF0) in southeast Chase County.  The supercell continued to move to the southeast, producing 2 different tornado damage paths across Greenwood county. The first Greenwood county tornado was an EF3, which is only the 5th such strong tornado to occur in Kansas during the month of July since 1950. The second Greenwood county tornado, moved northwest to southeast, through the town of Eureka, producing EF2 damage.  The supercell produced another brief touchdown (EF0) in open country in Wilson county.","The tornado touched down in open country and then moved southeast.  Towards the end of the tornadoes life, a home was hit and completely destroyed with all walls being compromised.  The walls were not adequately secured to the foundation, therefore, a lower rating was provided.  Otherwise, significant tree damage including snapped trunks were widespread along the river valley.  A corn crop was also completely decimated.  The odd track is due to this mesocyclone dissipating and a new one developing to the southeast and it became influenced by the airflow around the new circulation.
