Even though radar data suggested there were likely additional pockets of severe-criteria hail, the only limited ground-truth reports emanated from Zurich, from near Cedar and from rural northwestern Phillips County. Although the mesoscale environment was potentially supportive of a somewhat greater severe weather threat, the fairly rapid development of plentiful convection and resultant storm-scale outflow interference likely mitigated this. Despite the widespread activity, rainfall amounts across the vast majority of the local area averaged well-under 1. ||The first storms of the afternoon affected the local area between 3-4 p.m. CDT, as already-developed activity pushed into Mitchell County from the south and an isolated severe storm formed over southern Smith County. Over the course of the next few hours, several additional strong to marginally severe storms either popped up within, or pushed into the six-county area from the south, before convection steadily weakened and diminished in coverage between 6-7 p.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, the primary player was an expansive closed low churning slowly eastward through eastern Colorado, with several smaller-scale disturbances shifting northward into the Central Plains along its eastern flank. At the surface, there were no distinct synoptic features within North Central Kansas, only fairly weak, broad low pressure and prevailing light southerly to easterly breezes. Despite afternoon temperatures only rising into the low-70s F, the combination of surface dewpoints in the mid-50s and notably cold air aloft (evidenced by 500 millibar temps around -18 C) yielded mixed-layer CAPE values around 1000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",,CSV

This event was spurred by a combination of heavy May rainfall over upstream portions of northeast Colorado and the southern Nebraska Panhandle, coincident with above normal Rocky Mountains snow melt. Although the initial flooding within South Central Nebraska was largely tied to these upstream factors, it then perpetuated through much of June thanks to heavy rain falling directly over the local Platte basin, especially between the Kearney and Grand Island areas. Although peak water levels and impacts during this May-June event closely resembled those which occurred during the Platte River flooding of late-September to early-October 2013, this event was considerably more prolonged. The vast majority of local flooding impacts were noted within Dawson, Buffalo and Hall counties, mainly affecting pastures and lowlands immediately adjacent to the river, with very little impact to infrastructure. That being said, a few locations did experience legitimate disruptions. One of these was the Blue Heron Campground near Gothenburg, and another being the area around the south side of the Interstate 80 exit 312/Highway 281 interchange area near Grand Island, where water occasionally encroached into the parking lots of businesses. Water levels and resultant flooding concerns decreased downstream from the Grand Island area, largely due to the widening of the main river channel. ||Taking a closer look at the onset and timing of Platte River flooding within South Central Nebraska during May, the stage was set by heavy upstream rainfall coinciding with above normal snow melt. For the month of May as a whole, the vast majority of northeast Colorado and the southern Nebraska Panhandle received 5-10 of precipitation, or about 200-400 percent of normal. The Platte started creeping out of its banks in southwest Nebraska during the May 10-15 time frame. Within the local area, minor flooding got underway in the Dawson County area around May 16th, with the automated gauge near Cozad initially cresting around 6.7 feet (flood stage 6.5 feet) on the 20th. Downstream at the gauge near Kearney, flood stage of 6.0 feet was initially exceeded on the 18th, with a pair of crests around 7.0 feet occurring on the 22nd and again on the 31st. Farther east near Grand Island, the river initially crept above the 6.5 ft. flood stage between the 22nd-24th, then briefly dropped below flood for a few days before starting a more persistent rise above flood stage on the 31st. All three of these automated gauges either periodically reached, or consistently stayed above flood stage well into June (please refer to the June Storm Data entry for more specific information regarding the latter stages of this Platte River flooding).",,CSV

Even though radar data suggested there were likely additional pockets of severe-criteria hail, the only limited ground-truth reports emanated from Zurich, from near Cedar and from rural northwestern Phillips County. Although the mesoscale environment was potentially supportive of a somewhat greater severe weather threat, the fairly rapid development of plentiful convection and resultant storm-scale outflow interference likely mitigated this. Despite the widespread activity, rainfall amounts across the vast majority of the local area averaged well-under 1. ||The first storms of the afternoon affected the local area between 3-4 p.m. CDT, as already-developed activity pushed into Mitchell County from the south and an isolated severe storm formed over southern Smith County. Over the course of the next few hours, several additional strong to marginally severe storms either popped up within, or pushed into the six-county area from the south, before convection steadily weakened and diminished in coverage between 6-7 p.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, the primary player was an expansive closed low churning slowly eastward through eastern Colorado, with several smaller-scale disturbances shifting northward into the Central Plains along its eastern flank. At the surface, there were no distinct synoptic features within North Central Kansas, only fairly weak, broad low pressure and prevailing light southerly to easterly breezes. Despite afternoon temperatures only rising into the low-70s F, the combination of surface dewpoints in the mid-50s and notably cold air aloft (evidenced by 500 millibar temps around -18 C) yielded mixed-layer CAPE values around 1000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",,CSV

This storm yielded several reports of large hail and also the first tornado of 2015 within this six-county North Central Kansas area, an EF-0 that touched down three miles north of Smith Center and tracked for about one mile, damaging the roof of an outbuilding. Prior to this brief tornado, there had been several reports of a funnel cloud or multiple funnels as the storm traversed west-central Smith County. For most of its path, this supercell was primarily a hail-producer, as quarter size stones fell in Lebanon, Burr Oak and Formoso, and larger stones up to golf ball size rained down on Mankato for several minutes. ||Focusing on event timing, this storm initiated over the Smith-Phillips County line around 6 p.m. CDT, just ahead of an approaching cold front. At first, it appeared storm mode might assume a southwest-northeast oriented line segment, but a more discrete supercell structure quickly evolved as it tracked east down the Highway 36 corridor. As this storm reached eastern Jewell County around 8 p.m. CDT, it began morphing into a more linear structure that expanded southwestward into Mitchell County for a time. However, there were no further severe weather reports as all thunderstorms exited the local area by 930 p.m. CDT, in tandem with the passing cold front. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was provided by the southern reaches of a broad shortwave trough tracking east across the Central and especially Northern Plains, with this trough ushering in increasing west-southwest flow aloft. At the surface, the well-defined, northeast-southwest oriented cold front steadily swept through North Central Kansas during the evening. Ahead of this boundary, afternoon temperatures across most of the local area topped out between 75-80 F as dewpoints rose into the mid-upper 50s on gusty south winds. The presence of a weak surface low and attendant warm front in the immediate area likely contributed to tornado development, as local surface observations revealed a backing of wind direction to southeasterly ahead of the storm. As for basic severe weather parameters, mixed-layer CAPE values peaked in the 1000-1500 J/kg range in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 40-50 knots.","An EF-0 rated tornado occurred north-northeast of Smith Center, KS.

Nearly all thunderstorms focused east of a Greeley-Kearney-Alma line, and assumed primarily a quasi-linear, multicell mode. In terms of hail, most was only up to quarter size, including several reports from the vicinities of Boelus, Ravenna, Alma, Doniphan, Trumbull and Deshler.

As for wind gusts, speeds up to around 60 MPH were reported in or near Franklin, Blue Hill, Edgar and Ayr, with a home weather station northwest of Red Cloud clocking a peak gust of 73 MPH. Although no tornadoes occurred, the environment was conducive for a few gustnadoes along thunderstorm outflow, including one captured on storm chaser video east of Alma.

Even though radar data suggested there were likely additional pockets of severe-criteria hail, the only limited ground-truth reports emanated from Zurich, from near Cedar and from rural northwestern Phillips County. Although the mesoscale environment was potentially supportive of a somewhat greater severe weather threat, the fairly rapid development of plentiful convection and resultant storm-scale outflow interference likely mitigated this. Despite the widespread activity, rainfall amounts across the vast majority of the local area averaged well-under 1. ||The first storms of the afternoon affected the local area between 3-4 p.m. CDT, as already-developed activity pushed into Mitchell County from the south and an isolated severe storm formed over southern Smith County. Over the course of the next few hours, several additional strong to marginally severe storms either popped up within, or pushed into the six-county area from the south, before convection steadily weakened and diminished in coverage between 6-7 p.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, the primary player was an expansive closed low churning slowly eastward through eastern Colorado, with several smaller-scale disturbances shifting northward into the Central Plains along its eastern flank. At the surface, there were no distinct synoptic features within North Central Kansas, only fairly weak, broad low pressure and prevailing light southerly to easterly breezes. Despite afternoon temperatures only rising into the low-70s F, the combination of surface dewpoints in the mid-50s and notably cold air aloft (evidenced by 500 millibar temps around -18 C) yielded mixed-layer CAPE values around 1000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",,CSV

Although radar data suggested that various other locations likely experienced hail up to around this size, the only ground-truth reports originated from Hastings, Edgar and from the vicinities of Kearney, Sutton and Clay Center. While most of this convection was multicellular and linear, there were a few briefly semi-discrete structures as well. Rainfall amounts under most of the heaviest convection averaged between 0.50 and 1, with only few localized higher exceptions. ||Strong storms first developed into southwestern counties such as Harlan and Franklin between 430-600 p.m. CDT. Then between 6-9 p.m. CDT, a couple of narrow west-to-east arcs of strong storms developed eastward through the Highway 6 and Interstate 80 corridors and lifted slowly north, resulting in the aforementioned hail reports. After nightfall, a few stronger storms lingered over mainly Thayer and Fillmore counties for a time, but these steadily faded with the loss of diurnal heating. In the mid and upper levels, weak forcing was provided by small-scale disturbances shifting into the Central Plains on southerly flow aloft, well-downstream from an expansive large-scale closed low spinning over the Four Corners region. At the surface, afternoon high temperatures only climbed between the mid-60s and low-70s F across most of the area, but the combination of surface dewpoints in the mid-50s and rather cold air aloft (evidenced by 500 millibar temps around -16 C) was sufficient to promote modest surface-based CAPE as high as 500-1000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear only around 30 knots.",Nickel size hail occurred on the east side of Edgar.,CSV

And for the second straight night, the majority of storms concentrated within the southeastern half of the area. Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers). For the calendar days of June 3rd-5th, Hastings airport totaled 5.39, of which 4.74 fell on the 4th. This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Mostly nickel size hail fell, with a few quarter size hail stones mixed in.",CSV

As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Quarter size hail was reported by the public at a few different locations in the city of Grand Island, including near the intersection of Highway 281/Highway 2.",CSV

Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers).

This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border.

However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","A public report of one inch diameter hail was reported 5 miles southwest of Benedict, and also 5 miles north-northwest of York from a trained spotter.",CSV

Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties.

This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th.

With storms ranging in character from semi-discrete to clusters and line segments, they primarily produced hail up to around quarter size, along with heavy rain. Although convection affected parts of several counties at some point during the night, the majority of ground-truth severe weather reports emanated from Adams and Clay counties, including quarter size hail on the east side of Hastings, hail up to golf ball size in Clay Center, and several hours later, a combination of quarter size hail and estimated 60 MPH winds six miles east-southeast of Clay Center. Rainfall-wise, the big story of the night was a concentrated swath of generally 1.50-3.00 that fell over southern Hall/northern Adams counties, southeastward through most of Clay, Fillmore and northern Thayer counties. Within this corridor, a few of the highest overnight totals from NeRAIN observers included 3.13 near Alexandria and 3.00 a few miles northwest of Hastings. As a result, minor flooding affected several creeks and streams and some roadways. In fact, the southbound lanes of Highway 281 in far-southern Hall County were closed for a few hours during the night due to flooding. Although this generally minor flooding subsided during the day of the 4th, unfortunately many of these same areas would soon be drenched with another 2-4 on the evening of the 4th into the morning of the 5th, resulting in 36-hour totals of 3-7 and a more serious, widespread flooding situation (please refer to the separate June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. severe weather episode for further details). ||Breaking down the overall event timing, all convection through the pre-dark hours focused to the south over northern Kansas. Then, between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT, storms began developing northward into the southern two rows of South Central Nebraska counties, largely in response to a strengthening, northward-lifting low level jet. Over the course of the next several hours, numerous strong to occasionally severe storms continued spreading north and east across the area, with half dollar size hail reported as far north as southern Greeley County. Within the aforementioned primary zone of heavy rain, the majority fell between 2:30-6:00 a.m. CDT. As one area of storms was in the process of exiting eastern counties of the local area around sunrise, a separate, quick-moving line of non-severe convection moved in from the southwest, sweeping across most of South Central Nebraska between 5-9 a.m. CDT. Although a few storms persisted here and there through late-morning, most places began a brief respite before the next round of evening/overnight storms arrived. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front residing near the Nebraska-Kansas border through the night, seasonably-strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet taking direct aim on the local area, this was a well-anticipated nocturnal convective flare-up.

With storms ranging in character from semi-discrete to clusters and line segments, they primarily produced hail up to around quarter size, along with heavy rain. Although convection affected parts of several counties at some point during the night, the majority of ground-truth severe weather reports emanated from Adams and Clay counties, including quarter size hail on the east side of Hastings, hail up to golf ball size in Clay Center, and several hours later, a combination of quarter size hail and estimated 60 MPH winds six miles east-southeast of Clay Center. Rainfall-wise, the big story of the night was a concentrated swath of generally 1.50-3.00 that fell over southern Hall/northern Adams counties, southeastward through most of Clay, Fillmore and northern Thayer counties. Within this corridor, a few of the highest overnight totals from NeRAIN observers included 3.13 near Alexandria and 3.00 a few miles northwest of Hastings. As a result, minor flooding affected several creeks and streams and some roadways. In fact, the southbound lanes of Highway 281 in far-southern Hall County were closed for a few hours during the night due to flooding. Although this generally minor flooding subsided during the day of the 4th, unfortunately many of these same areas would soon be drenched with another 2-4 on the evening of the 4th into the morning of the 5th, resulting in 36-hour totals of 3-7 and a more serious, widespread flooding situation (please refer to the separate June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. severe weather episode for further details). ||Breaking down the overall event timing, all convection through the pre-dark hours focused to the south over northern Kansas. Then, between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT, storms began developing northward into the southern two rows of South Central Nebraska counties, largely in response to a strengthening, northward-lifting low level jet. Over the course of the next several hours, numerous strong to occasionally severe storms continued spreading north and east across the area, with half dollar size hail reported as far north as southern Greeley County. Within the aforementioned primary zone of heavy rain, the majority fell between 2:30-6:00 a.m. CDT. As one area of storms was in the process of exiting eastern counties of the local area around sunrise, a separate, quick-moving line of non-severe convection moved in from the southwest, sweeping across most of South Central Nebraska between 5-9 a.m. CDT. Although a few storms persisted here and there through late-morning, most places began a brief respite before the next round of evening/overnight storms arrived. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front residing near the Nebraska-Kansas border through the night, seasonably-strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet taking direct aim on the local area, this was a well-anticipated nocturnal convective flare-up. On the large scale, the Central Plains was under broad west-southwest flow aloft, well-downstream from a large trough centered over the West Coast. At the time of the first severe-criteria hail reports around 11:30 p.m. CDT, the environment featured most-unstable CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg and 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.","Flooding occurred on the southbound lane of Highway 281 near Rosedale Road, and caused a few traffic accidents.",CSV

And for the second straight night, the majority of storms concentrated within the southeastern half of the area. Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers).

This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall totaled generally 4-7 across primarily southern Hamilton County between the 3rd-6th, with the majority of this rain falling on the 4th-5th.

Over the next few days, the main story turned to the West Fork Big Blue River and its smaller stream tributaries in the southern part of the county, as the cumulative effects of multiple rounds of heavy rain resulted in significant flooding, mainly on the 5th-6th.

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear.

This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall totaled generally 4-7 across much of Fillmore County between the 3rd-6th, with the majority of this rain falling on the 4th-5th. The cumulative effects of multiple heavy rains resulted in significant flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River and its smaller stream tributaries in the northern part of the county, mainly on the 6th-7th. Reports indicated that this may have been some the worst flooding observed along the river in 50-80 years. A few days of warm and dry weather settled in from June 7-9, allowing flood waters to largely recede. However, another focused area of 1.50-3.00 of heavy rain targeted the York and northern Fillmore counties area on the night of the 10th into the morning of the 11th. This again pushed the West Fork Big Blue River out of its banks in the McCool Junction area from the 11th into the 12th, before this multiple-day flooding event finally came to a close.",CSV

While these storms yielded mainly quarter size hail, and one report up to 2 diameter south of Burr Oak, the storm of the night was a slow-moving tornadic supercell that peaked in intensity from far east-central Osborne into central Mitchell County between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT. This storm produced three confirmed after-dark tornadoes, two rated EF-1 with path lengths around one mile near the Osborne/Mitchell County line west of Tipton, and a brief EF-0 touchdown slightly east of Tipton. The two stronger tornadoes, one of which moved east and one west under the parent mesocyclone, damaged or destroyed several farm outbuildings, but no injuries occurred. Around midnight CDT, this storm began losing supercell structure and weakening as it drifted northeast through the Beloit area. In addition to tornadoes, this storm produced torrential rainfall of at least 3-4 in a short time across central and western portions of Mitchell County. Other storms produced a swath of heavy rain of generally 1.50-3.00 across much of southern Jewell County. However, the majority of the six-county area totaled no more than 0.50-1.00.  ||Breaking down the overall event timing, several strong to severe storms first blossomed over Rooks and Osborne counties between 700-830 p.m. CDT. Over the next few hours, activity gradually expanded to the north and east, as the aforementioned tornadic supercell took center stage around nightfall. Between 130-230 a.m. CDT on the 4th, storms vacated the entire six-county area to the north and east. Several hours later between 6-8 a.m. CDT, additional elevated storms flared up primarily east of Highway 281, but were non-severe. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front draped through the northern half of Kansas, seasonably strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet ramping up during the night, this was a well-anticipated severe weather event. On the large scale, the Central Plains was under broad west-southwest flow aloft, well-downstream from a large trough centered over the West Coast. While modest capping held storms at bay through the afternoon, the combination of subtle, low-amplitude disturbances aloft and increasing lift along the developing low level jet sparked a rapid evening flare-up. At the surface, the evening hours featured steady easterly breezes and dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s F. Around the time the tornadic supercell developed, the mesoscale environment featured mixed-layer CAPE around 2000 J/kg, 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots, and fairly strong 0-1 kilometer storm-relative helicity of at least 150 m2/s2.","This tornado moved west, and began with damage to a silo and large metal building. On the tornado's trek, it tossed grain bin debris about three quarters of a mile. The tornado narrowly missed a new home, but damaged a vacant home on the same property. The tornado lifted in a field west of the farmstead. The movement of this tornado, along with the eastward moving tornado to the south, suggested that the parent mesocyclone associated with the supercell storm was near the ground and that the two tornadoes were rotating within that circulation.",CSV

And for the second straight night, the majority of storms concentrated within the southeastern half of the area. Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers). For the calendar days of June 3rd-5th, Hastings airport totaled 5.39, of which 4.74 fell on the 4th. This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","A 24-hour rainfall total of 3.00 in Clay Center...most of which fell during the evening of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th.

And for the second straight night, the majority of storms concentrated within the southeastern half of the area. Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers). For the calendar days of June 3rd-5th, Hastings airport totaled 5.39, of which 4.74 fell on the 4th. This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall totaled generally 4-7 across primarily northern Adams County between the 3rd-6th, with the majority of this rain falling on the 4th-5th. Road flooding was initially reported across parts of the county on the evening of the 4th. On the morning of the 5th, the Adams County Department of Roads reported that many roads (paved and gravel) were closed due to severe flooding, especially within the northeast quadrant of the county. Just as one example of these road closures, paved Showboat Road from 12th Street to 26th Street was barricaded on the east side of Hastings for several hours on the 5th.

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear. During the night, widespread weak convection persisted within the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet.","Wind gusts estimated to be near 70 MPH resulted in large tree limbs being downed in Arcadia, some as large as 10-12 in diameter.",CSV

While these storms yielded mainly quarter size hail, and one report up to 2 diameter south of Burr Oak, the storm of the night was a slow-moving tornadic supercell that peaked in intensity from far east-central Osborne into central Mitchell County between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT. This storm produced three confirmed after-dark tornadoes, two rated EF-1 with path lengths around one mile near the Osborne/Mitchell County line west of Tipton, and a brief EF-0 touchdown slightly east of Tipton. The two stronger tornadoes, one of which moved east and one west under the parent mesocyclone, damaged or destroyed several farm outbuildings, but no injuries occurred. Around midnight CDT, this storm began losing supercell structure and weakening as it drifted northeast through the Beloit area. In addition to tornadoes, this storm produced torrential rainfall of at least 3-4 in a short time across central and western portions of Mitchell County. Other storms produced a swath of heavy rain of generally 1.50-3.00 across much of southern Jewell County. However, the majority of the six-county area totaled no more than 0.50-1.00.  ||Breaking down the overall event timing, several strong to severe storms first blossomed over Rooks and Osborne counties between 700-830 p.m. CDT. Over the next few hours, activity gradually expanded to the north and east, as the aforementioned tornadic supercell took center stage around nightfall. Between 130-230 a.m. CDT on the 4th, storms vacated the entire six-county area to the north and east. Several hours later between 6-8 a.m. CDT, additional elevated storms flared up primarily east of Highway 281, but were non-severe. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front draped through the northern half of Kansas, seasonably strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet ramping up during the night, this was a well-anticipated severe weather event. On the large scale, the Central Plains was under broad west-southwest flow aloft, well-downstream from a large trough centered over the West Coast. While modest capping held storms at bay through the afternoon, the combination of subtle, low-amplitude disturbances aloft and increasing lift along the developing low level jet sparked a rapid evening flare-up. At the surface, the evening hours featured steady easterly breezes and dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s F. Around the time the tornadic supercell developed, the mesoscale environment featured mixed-layer CAPE around 2000 J/kg, 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots, and fairly strong 0-1 kilometer storm-relative helicity of at least 150 m2/s2.","This was a brief tornado that toppled an empty grain bin, and also topped an elm tree and knocked over a metal TV antenna before lifting.",CSV

Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers). For the calendar days of June 3rd-5th, Hastings airport totaled 5.39, of which 4.74 fell on the 4th. This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall totaled generally 4-7 across much of York County between the 3rd-6th, with the majority of this rain falling on the 4th-5th. Localized road flooding was initially reported in the York area on the evening of the 4th. Over the next few days, the main story turned to the West Fork Big Blue River in the southern part of the county, as significant flooding worked its way downstream, reaching the McCool Junction area on Saturday the 6th. Parts of McCool Junction were closed off due to flood waters and at least two homes were flooded. However, at least five homes were saved due to sandbagging efforts. All county roads crossing the river in southern York County were blocked off. Reports indicated that this may have bee some the worst flooding observed along the West Fork Big Blue in 50-80 years. Among other impacts, flood water entered Camp Kateri and the camp area was evacuated. A few days of warm and dry weather settled in from June 7-9, allowing flood waters to largely recede. However, another focused swath of 1.50-3.00 of heavy rain targeted the York and northern Fillmore counties area on the night of the 10th into the morning of the 11th. This again pushed the West Fork Big Blue River out of its banks in the McCool Junction area from the 11th into the 12th, before this multiple-day flooding event finally came to a close (see episode narrative for more details).",CSV

And for the second straight night, the majority of storms concentrated within the southeastern half of the area. Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers). For the calendar days of June 3rd-5th, Hastings airport totaled 5.39, of which 4.74 fell on the 4th. This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall totaled generally 4-7 across much of Clay County between the 3rd-6th, with the majority of this rain falling on the 4th-5th. Localized road flooding was initially reported across parts of the county on the evening of the 4th. Over the next few days, the main story turned to the West Fork Big Blue River and its smaller stream tributaries in the northern part of the county, as the cumulative effects of multiple rounds of heavy rain resulted in significant flooding, mainly on the 5th-6th. Reports indicated that this may have been some the worst flooding observed along the west fork Big Blue in 50-80 years. A few days of warm and dry weather settled in from June 7-9, allowing flood waters to largely recede.",CSV

This storm produced three confirmed after-dark tornadoes, two rated EF-1 with path lengths around one mile near the Osborne/Mitchell County line west of Tipton, and a brief EF-0 touchdown slightly east of Tipton. The two stronger tornadoes, one of which moved east and one west under the parent mesocyclone, damaged or destroyed several farm outbuildings, but no injuries occurred.

Storm mode primarily consisted of multicell clusters and lines, and the only ground-truth severe-criteria report was estimated 60 MPH gusts in northwestern Smith County at 9 p.m. CDT. During the preceding hour, this same small-scale linear complex yielded several reports of near-severe gusts in the 50-55 MPH range across Phillips County. As for rainfall, the majority of the local area only reported modest amounts of 0.50-1.00. However, much of Jewell and Mitchell counties tallied closer to 1.50, with a small section of southeast Jewell and northeast Mitchell, including the Randall area, getting drenched with at least 2.50-3.00. Despite a lack of ground-truth reports, it can be reasonably assumed that there were some short-term flooding issues in this area lasting into the day of the 11th. ||As for some timing details, the first few storms of the day initiated over Phillips and Smith counties between 5:45-7:00 p.m. CDT before quickly departing northward into Nebraska. Following a short lull, the next storm cluster marched into Phillips/Rooks counties from the west between 7:45-8:45 p.m. CDT and went on to produce the 60 MPH winds in Smith County. Through the remainder of the night, numerous non-severe storms continued streaming across the area, with most places finally rain-free by 6 a.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, the most evident boundary near the local area during the afternoon was a trough axis extending southwestward to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising into the mid-upper 90s, storms developed in an environment featuring 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 30 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear. During the night, widespread weak convection persisted within the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet.",Wind gusts estimated to be near 60 MPH resulted in a few tree limbs being downed and some minor shingle damage.,CSV

With storms ranging in character from semi-discrete to clusters and line segments, they primarily produced hail up to around quarter size, along with heavy rain. Although convection affected parts of several counties at some point during the night, the majority of ground-truth severe weather reports emanated from Adams and Clay counties, including quarter size hail on the east side of Hastings, hail up to golf ball size in Clay Center, and several hours later, a combination of quarter size hail and estimated 60 MPH winds six miles east-southeast of Clay Center. Rainfall-wise, the big story of the night was a concentrated swath of generally 1.50-3.00 that fell over southern Hall/northern Adams counties, southeastward through most of Clay, Fillmore and northern Thayer counties. Within this corridor, a few of the highest overnight totals from NeRAIN observers included 3.13 near Alexandria and 3.00 a few miles northwest of Hastings. As a result, minor flooding affected several creeks and streams and some roadways. In fact, the southbound lanes of Highway 281 in far-southern Hall County were closed for a few hours during the night due to flooding. Although this generally minor flooding subsided during the day of the 4th, unfortunately many of these same areas would soon be drenched with another 2-4 on the evening of the 4th into the morning of the 5th, resulting in 36-hour totals of 3-7 and a more serious, widespread flooding situation (please refer to the separate June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. severe weather episode for further details). ||Breaking down the overall event timing, all convection through the pre-dark hours focused to the south over northern Kansas. Then, between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT, storms began developing northward into the southern two rows of South Central Nebraska counties, largely in response to a strengthening, northward-lifting low level jet. Over the course of the next several hours, numerous strong to occasionally severe storms continued spreading north and east across the area, with half dollar size hail reported as far north as southern Greeley County. Within the aforementioned primary zone of heavy rain, the majority fell between 2:30-6:00 a.m. CDT. As one area of storms was in the process of exiting eastern counties of the local area around sunrise, a separate, quick-moving line of non-severe convection moved in from the southwest, sweeping across most of South Central Nebraska between 5-9 a.m. CDT. Although a few storms persisted here and there through late-morning, most places began a brief respite before the next round of evening/overnight storms arrived. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front residing near the Nebraska-Kansas border through the night, seasonably-strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet taking direct aim on the local area, this was a well-anticipated nocturnal convective flare-up. On the large scale, the Central Plains was under broad west-southwest flow aloft, well-downstream from a large trough centered over the West Coast. At the time of the first severe-criteria hail reports around 11:30 p.m. CDT, the environment featured most-unstable CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg and 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",Quarter to golf ball size hail fell during this time in Clay Center.,CSV

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear. During the night, widespread weak convection persisted within the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet.",,CSV

A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear. During the night, widespread weak convection persisted within the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet.",Wind gusts estimated to be near 70 MPH resulted in the derailment of seven BNSF freight train cars in extreme western Adams County (the train had a total of 72 cars).

These slightly elevated storms primarily produced small hail and brief heavy rain before mostly-departing the local area to the south and east by 11 p.m. CDT. However, one storm pulsed up to severe thresholds over southern Mitchell County, yielding a quarter size hail report. Shortly after this first round of storms vacated the local area, yet another southwest-to-northeast complex of convection fired up over North Central Kansas between 11:00-11:30 p.m. CDT. Unlike its predecessor though, this round remained sub-severe as it too gradually departed to the south and east by around 2 a.m. CDT, ending all local thunderstorm activity for the night. Rainfall-wise, amounts varied rather widely, ranging from little to nothing (especially within northern portions of Phillips/Smith/Jewell counties) to pockets up to around 1 (especially within southern portions of Osborne/Jewell/Mitchell counties). Wettest of all was a portion of south central Mitchell County, which likely received at least 1.50-2.00. ||In terms of forcing mechanisms, the most pertinent feature was a modest evening increase in convergence along a fairly sharp, slightly-elevated frontal zone evident at 850 millibars. This boundary was stretched in west-to-east fashion directly over the local area, roughly 60-80 miles north of a corresponding surface front draped through central Kansas. As the night went on, this elevated frontal zone pressed southward, taking thunderstorm chances out of the local area with it. On the larger scale synoptic scene, lift was provided by a broad shortwave trough dropping southeastward into the region from the Northern Plains. Around the time of the quarter size hail report in Mitchell County, the mesoscale environment featured 1000-2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and around 40 knots of effective shear.",,CSV

With storms ranging in character from semi-discrete to clusters and line segments, they primarily produced hail up to around quarter size, along with heavy rain. Although convection affected parts of several counties at some point during the night, the majority of ground-truth severe weather reports emanated from Adams and Clay counties, including quarter size hail on the east side of Hastings, hail up to golf ball size in Clay Center, and several hours later, a combination of quarter size hail and estimated 60 MPH winds six miles east-southeast of Clay Center. Rainfall-wise, the big story of the night was a concentrated swath of generally 1.50-3.00 that fell over southern Hall/northern Adams counties, southeastward through most of Clay, Fillmore and northern Thayer counties. Within this corridor, a few of the highest overnight totals from NeRAIN observers included 3.13 near Alexandria and 3.00 a few miles northwest of Hastings. As a result, minor flooding affected several creeks and streams and some roadways. In fact, the southbound lanes of Highway 281 in far-southern Hall County were closed for a few hours during the night due to flooding. Although this generally minor flooding subsided during the day of the 4th, unfortunately many of these same areas would soon be drenched with another 2-4 on the evening of the 4th into the morning of the 5th, resulting in 36-hour totals of 3-7 and a more serious, widespread flooding situation (please refer to the separate June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. severe weather episode for further details). ||Breaking down the overall event timing, all convection through the pre-dark hours focused to the south over northern Kansas. Then, between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT, storms began developing northward into the southern two rows of South Central Nebraska counties, largely in response to a strengthening, northward-lifting low level jet. Over the course of the next several hours, numerous strong to occasionally severe storms continued spreading north and east across the area, with half dollar size hail reported as far north as southern Greeley County. Within the aforementioned primary zone of heavy rain, the majority fell between 2:30-6:00 a.m. CDT. As one area of storms was in the process of exiting eastern counties of the local area around sunrise, a separate, quick-moving line of non-severe convection moved in from the southwest, sweeping across most of South Central Nebraska between 5-9 a.m. CDT. Although a few storms persisted here and there through late-morning, most places began a brief respite before the next round of evening/overnight storms arrived. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front residing near the Nebraska-Kansas border through the night, seasonably-strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet taking direct aim on the local area, this was a well-anticipated nocturnal convective flare-up.

With storms ranging in character from semi-discrete to clusters and line segments, they primarily produced hail up to around quarter size, along with heavy rain. Although convection affected parts of several counties at some point during the night, the majority of ground-truth severe weather reports emanated from Adams and Clay counties, including quarter size hail on the east side of Hastings, hail up to golf ball size in Clay Center, and several hours later, a combination of quarter size hail and estimated 60 MPH winds six miles east-southeast of Clay Center. Rainfall-wise, the big story of the night was a concentrated swath of generally 1.50-3.00 that fell over southern Hall/northern Adams counties, southeastward through most of Clay, Fillmore and northern Thayer counties. Within this corridor, a few of the highest overnight totals from NeRAIN observers included 3.13 near Alexandria and 3.00 a few miles northwest of Hastings. As a result, minor flooding affected several creeks and streams and some roadways. In fact, the southbound lanes of Highway 281 in far-southern Hall County were closed for a few hours during the night due to flooding. Although this generally minor flooding subsided during the day of the 4th, unfortunately many of these same areas would soon be drenched with another 2-4 on the evening of the 4th into the morning of the 5th, resulting in 36-hour totals of 3-7 and a more serious, widespread flooding situation (please refer to the separate June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. severe weather episode for further details). ||Breaking down the overall event timing, all convection through the pre-dark hours focused to the south over northern Kansas. Then, between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT, storms began developing northward into the southern two rows of South Central Nebraska counties, largely in response to a strengthening, northward-lifting low level jet. Over the course of the next several hours, numerous strong to occasionally severe storms continued spreading north and east across the area, with half dollar size hail reported as far north as southern Greeley County. Within the aforementioned primary zone of heavy rain, the majority fell between 2:30-6:00 a.m. CDT. As one area of storms was in the process of exiting eastern counties of the local area around sunrise, a separate, quick-moving line of non-severe convection moved in from the southwest, sweeping across most of South Central Nebraska between 5-9 a.m. CDT. Although a few storms persisted here and there through late-morning, most places began a brief respite before the next round of evening/overnight storms arrived. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front residing near the Nebraska-Kansas border through the night, seasonably-strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet taking direct aim on the local area, this was a well-anticipated nocturnal convective flare-up. On the large scale, the Central Plains was under broad west-southwest flow aloft, well-downstream from a large trough centered over the West Coast. At the time of the first severe-criteria hail reports around 11:30 p.m. CDT, the environment featured most-unstable CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg and 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",Pea to quarter size hail lasted around 10 minutes.,CSV

In fact, the only local severe-criteria report consisted of quarter size hail west of Phillipsburg shortly after 9:30 p.m. CDT, produced by a briefly-severe, semi-discrete storm that drifted northeastward across the heart of the county. Otherwise, the vast majority of storms on this night produced nothing more than sub-severe wind gusts and pockets of moderate to briefly-heavy rainfall. Based on a combination of gauge reports and radar estimation, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 of rain, except for higher totals potentially in excess of 1.50 that fell primarily within northeastern Jewell, northern Phillips and extreme northwestern Rooks counties. Even so, there were no known reports of impactful flooding issues. ||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity, the first few semi-discrete storms developed into Phillips and northern Rooks counties between 8:30-10:00 p.m. CDT, including the one that produced quarter size hail. Through the remainder of the night and lasting into morning hours on the 5th, numerous, primarily weak storms affected much of the local area. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: this was a fairly similar setup to the one that produced the more significant severe weather event within North Central Kansas the night before, as a quasi-stationary, composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. However, this time around no organized supercell storms were able to develop, and the most vigorous late-night convection focused slightly north and east of the local area within the primary exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet. On the large scale, the parent mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast as a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with a rather unstable airmass to trigger vigorous convection.

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear.

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies.

Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT.

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.

This flooding event got underway during the May 15th-20th time frame, initially spurred by a combination of heavy rainfall over upstream portions of northeast Colorado and the southern Nebraska Panhandle, coincident with above normal Rocky Mountains snow melt. During June, flooding persisted, and at times worsened, thanks to multiple rounds of heavy rain falling directly over the local Platte basin, especially downstream from Kearney. Although peak water levels and impacts during this May-June event closely resembled those which occurred during the Platte River flooding of late-September to early-October 2013, this event was considerably more prolonged. The vast majority of local flooding impacts were noted within Dawson, Buffalo and Hall counties, mainly affecting pastures and lowlands immediately adjacent to the river, with very little impact to infrastructure. That being said, a few locations did experience legitimate disruptions. One of these was the Blue Heron Campground near Gothenburg, and another was the area around the south side of the Interstate 80/Highway 281 interchange (exit 312) near Grand Island, where water occasionally encroached into the parking lots of businesses. Flooding concerns were noticeably lower downstream from the Grand Island area, largely due to the widening of the main river channel. ||Taking a closer look at local flooding trends during June, of three automated Platte river gauges near Cozad, Kearney and Grand Island, all of them spent the majority of the month in minor flood stage. Grand Island even briefly exceeded moderate flood stage of 7.0 feet on two occasions, first on the 5th and again on the 19th. The gauge sites near Cozad and Grand Island briefly dropped slightly below flood stage for a few days around mid-month, before going into flood again. In general, there were June crests in water levels, one early in the month between mainly the 2nd-8th, and again later in the month from primarily the 17th-23rd. The early-month peak was clearly tied to multiple rounds of heavy rain that fell between the 3rd-6th. During this four-day stretch, a concentrated area of the Platte basin between Kearney, Hastings and Grand Island was drenched with 3-7. During a heavy rain event at Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the river actually flowed over South Locust St. near Interstate 80 exit 314 for a short time.

This flooding event got underway during the May 15th-20th time frame, initially spurred by a combination of heavy rainfall over upstream portions of northeast Colorado and the southern Nebraska Panhandle, coincident with above normal Rocky Mountains snow melt. During June, flooding persisted, and at times worsened, thanks to multiple rounds of heavy rain falling directly over the local Platte basin, especially downstream from Kearney. Although peak water levels and impacts during this May-June event closely resembled those which occurred during the Platte River flooding of late-September to early-October 2013, this event was considerably more prolonged. The vast majority of local flooding impacts were noted within Dawson, Buffalo and Hall counties, mainly affecting pastures and lowlands immediately adjacent to the river, with very little impact to infrastructure. That being said, a few locations did experience legitimate disruptions.

And for the second straight night, the majority of storms concentrated within the southeastern half of the area. Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers). For the calendar days of June 3rd-5th, Hastings airport totaled 5.39, of which 4.74 fell on the 4th. This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","Several intersections were flooded in Grand Island due to heavy rain.

While none of these storms breached severe thresholds, a few likely produced small hail, with the only ground-truth report consisting of nickel size stones in Cozad during one of the first storms of the night. As for timing, scattered elevated storms developed almost simultaneously in two separate areas between midnight-1 a.m. CDT, one over Dawson County and the other farther northeast over Valley/Greeley/Nance counties. Over the next few hours, this initial convection tracked east while new storms flared up in its wake. By 5 a.m. CDT, all local activity had departed eastward into eastern Nebraska. ||This was a fairly classic round of nocturnal convection, as the nose of a rather strong 40-45 knot low level jet took aim on the local area, surging over the top of a well-defined surface stationary front draped along the Nebraska-Kansas border, which separated easterly low level flow to its north from southerly breezes to its south. In the mid-upper levels, modest zonal flow was in place, as the Central Plains was sandwiched between a west-to-east oriented ridge centered over the OK area, and much stronger westerly flow over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest. Around the time of the Cozad hail report, the mesoscale environment featured up to around 2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-35 knots of deep-layer wind shear. Although this environment might have otherwise supported a more robust threat of large hail, warm air aloft as noted by 700 millibar temperatures of at least 12-14C likely enhanced convective inhibition (CIN) even for elevated parcels.",,CSV

And for the second straight night, the majority of storms concentrated within the southeastern half of the area. Although the first few hours of evening convection yielded several hail reports up to mainly quarter size within Hall, Hamilton, Merrick and York counties, by far the biggest story of the night, and for some places for the next several days thereafter, was heavy rainfall and resultant flooding. During the 24-hour period ending around sunrise on the 5th, widespread rainfall of 2-4 drenched several counties, primarily including: Adams, Clay, Fillmore, York, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall and southern Hamilton. Combined with as much as 1.50-3.00 that fell across some of these same areas during the preceding night, the net result was 36-hour rain totals of generally 3-7, with the overall-highest concentration of 5-7 impacting a fairly narrow, roughly 10-mile wide corridor extending through southeast Hall, northeast Adams, southern Hamilton, northern Clay and western Fillmore counties. As just a few specific examples of 36-hour measured totals ending around sunrise on the 5th: 6.44 at Harvard and 5.28 four miles west of Geneva (NeRAIN observers). For the calendar days of June 3rd-5th, Hastings airport totaled 5.39, of which 4.74 fell on the 4th. This total set a new Hastings daily record for June rainfall, and was the third-highest daily total for any day of the year. Needless to say, widespread flooding of creeks, streams and primarily rural roadways was well-underway in the aforementioned counties by daybreak on the 5th. Adams county Emergency Management issued a press release alerting citizens that some roads are impassable and dangerous due to standing water and possible unknown damage in the northeast part of the county. Earlier on, during the initial stages of heavy rain on the evening of the 4th, significant street flooding impacted many communities including Grand Island, where several city streets were closed for a few hours. Also near Grand Island on the evening of the 4th, the Platte River (which had already been slightly above flood stage for a few weeks) briefly rose far enough out of its banks to overflow Locust Street near the Interstate 80 exit 314 interchange. Getting back to the daytime hours on the 5th, although flooding of roads and small streams began to very slowly subside, issues began ramping up on larger creeks and rivers. Most notably, this included the West Fork Big Blue River, which was centered almost directly under the narrow axis of heaviest rain and experienced historic flooding over the next several days (please refer to the separate paragraph below for more details regarding West Fork Big Blue River flooding).||Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of local thunderstorm activity from the afternoon of the 4th into the early morning of the 5th...there were several different rounds. Following a brief lull in the wake of widespread activity during the early morning of the 4th, the next round of mainly non-severe storms affected counties primarily along/north of Interstate 80 through most of the afternoon hours. These storms yielded only one severe weather report: quarter size hail near Pleasanton. Following another brief lull during the late afternoon and early evening, a narrow swath of hail and torrential rain-producing severe storms blew up between 7-9 p.m. CDT along an axis from near Grand Island and Central City, eastward to near Stromsburg and York. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT, this vigorous line of convection gradually weakened as it sank southward toward the Kansas border, but continued dumping heavy rain. Beyond 11 p.m., the next several hours featured widespread, persistent development of non-severe-but-heavy-rain producing convection over most counties along and south of Interstate 80, largely driven by convergence/lift along the nose of a nocturnal, 30-40 knot low level jet. Finally, between 3-6 a.m. CDT on the 5th, storms steadily diminished in intensity and ended from north-to-south, leaving only lingering light rain over the Nebraska-Kansas border area by sunrise. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: this was a fairly similar situation to the night before, as a quasi-stationary composite surface front/outflow boundary remained in place near the Nebraska-Kansas border. Although the primary large scale mid-upper trough remained well to the west along the California coast, a series of downstream low-amplitude disturbances passed through the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow, interacting with an unstable and very moist airmass to trigger vigorous convection. Around the time of the initial evening hail-producing storms, the mesoscale environment featured around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear. ||June 5th-12th Summary of Historic Flooding Along the West Fork Big Blue River from near the Adams/Clay County line downstream through southeastern York County...deemed to be the worst flooding in 50-80 years: As detailed in the first paragraph above, 36-hour rainfall totals averaged 5-7 along much of the local stretch of the West Fork Big Blue River between the evening of June 3rd and the morning of June 5th. As a result, significant flooding commenced along the river and its smaller tributaries on the 5th, with the primary flood crest initially working its way across the northern Clay and southern Hamilton County area. By the daylight hours on Saturday the 6th, the seriousness of the flooding situation became more apparent for downstream communities such as McCool Junction. Residents in southern Hamilton County were already calling it the worst flooding they had witnessed in 50-80 years, as the crest reached the Lushton area of York County by late morning. Around this time, officials in McCool Junction began evacuations of several homes on the east side of town along the rising river, along with sandbagging operations. Around 12:30 p.m. CDT, water entered a church camp just south of town, cutting off access to it. The West Fork Big Blue crested in the immediate McCool Junction area that evening, but only a few homes suffered significant flooding. It was reported that at least five homes were saved due to advance notice of the approaching crest and resultant sandbagging. By daylight on Sunday morning June 7th, water levels had receded 1-2 feet at McCool Junction, as the crest worked downstream to near the York/Seward County line. Over the next few days, a welcomed-stretch of warm and dry weather allowed the river to slowly recede back within its banks over southern York County, and the initial multi-day Flood Warning was allowed to expire on Wednesday, June 10th. However, Mother Nature soon threw one last curveball at the McCool Junction area, as yet another round of heavy rain on the order of 1.50-3.00 fell into much of the West Fork Big Blue basin on the evening of the 10th into the morning of Thursday the 11th. As a result, a secondary, less-severe round of flooding was reported at McCool Junction by 10 a.m. CDT on the 11th, with the river reported to be one foot out of its banks. This second round of primarily minor flooding persisted into the daytime hours on Friday, June 12th, but largely abated by sunset that evening, finally ending over one week of flooding issues along the West Fork Big Blue River in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska.","The official June 4th rainfall total for Hastings airport was 4.74 inches. The total includes 1.90 inches in the morning, and 2.84 inches in the evening. This is the third highest daily total on record at Hastings for any day of the year, and is the highest daily total on record for the month of June. Total Hastings airport rainfall from June 3rd-5th was 5.39. Two-day rainfall totals of 3-7 were common within much of Adams, Clay, Fillmore, Nuckolls, Thayer, southern Hall, southern Hamilton and southern York counties, resulting in significant flooding across parts of the area.",CSV

While these storms yielded mainly quarter size hail, and one report up to 2 diameter south of Burr Oak, the storm of the night was a slow-moving tornadic supercell that peaked in intensity from far east-central Osborne into central Mitchell County between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT. This storm produced three confirmed after-dark tornadoes, two rated EF-1 with path lengths around one mile near the Osborne/Mitchell County line west of Tipton, and a brief EF-0 touchdown slightly east of Tipton. The two stronger tornadoes, one of which moved east and one west under the parent mesocyclone, damaged or destroyed several farm outbuildings, but no injuries occurred. Around midnight CDT, this storm began losing supercell structure and weakening as it drifted northeast through the Beloit area. In addition to tornadoes, this storm produced torrential rainfall of at least 3-4 in a short time across central and western portions of Mitchell County. Other storms produced a swath of heavy rain of generally 1.50-3.00 across much of southern Jewell County. However, the majority of the six-county area totaled no more than 0.50-1.00.  ||Breaking down the overall event timing, several strong to severe storms first blossomed over Rooks and Osborne counties between 700-830 p.m. CDT. Over the next few hours, activity gradually expanded to the north and east, as the aforementioned tornadic supercell took center stage around nightfall. Between 130-230 a.m. CDT on the 4th, storms vacated the entire six-county area to the north and east. Several hours later between 6-8 a.m. CDT, additional elevated storms flared up primarily east of Highway 281, but were non-severe. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front draped through the northern half of Kansas, seasonably strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet ramping up during the night, this was a well-anticipated severe weather event. On the large scale, the Central Plains was under broad west-southwest flow aloft, well-downstream from a large trough centered over the West Coast. While modest capping held storms at bay through the afternoon, the combination of subtle, low-amplitude disturbances aloft and increasing lift along the developing low level jet sparked a rapid evening flare-up. At the surface, the evening hours featured steady easterly breezes and dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s F. Around the time the tornadic supercell developed, the mesoscale environment featured mixed-layer CAPE around 2000 J/kg, 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots, and fairly strong 0-1 kilometer storm-relative helicity of at least 150 m2/s2.",,CSV

During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center.

During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center.

As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph.

The temperature profile was very marginal, but snow continued to fall through the day. Due to its persistence, some wet accumulations of 1 to 2 inches occurred on grassy surfaces along Highway 81 from Geneva south to Hebron. During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of south central Nebraska for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281. By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into southeast Nebraska. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 4 to 8 inches along and east of Highway 281. The highest amount of 9 inches was measured just north of Aurora. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. Blizzard conditions occurred, at times, with the visibility down to one-quarter mile. Significant impacts occurred with several portions of Interstate 80 being closed due to numerous traffic accidents.

By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into southeast Nebraska. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 4 to 8 inches along and east of Highway 281. The highest amount of 9 inches was measured just north of Aurora. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. Blizzard conditions occurred, at times, with the visibility down to one-quarter mile. Significant impacts occurred with several portions of Interstate 80 being closed due to numerous traffic accidents. Some roads were restricted to one lane while other highways were closed due to white-out conditions over Clay, Fillmore, Nuckolls, Thayer, Webster counties. Adams county issued a no travel advisory. Nearly every school was closed Monday, February 2nd, east of a line from Ord to Franklin. This included the University of Nebraska at Kearney and Central Community College near Hastings. ||The initial wet snow Saturday occurred in warm air advection, in the entrance region of a 150 kt upper-level jet streak. The forcing for precipitation changed, however, as an arctic cold front sagged through Nebraska with lee cyclogenesis occurring ahead of it over southeastern Colorado. As the front continued moving south into Kansas Saturday night, the weak low left Colorado and progressed east along the front. It was located near Kansas City by daybreak Sunday and advanced east into Indiana by sunset. It was this low that was responsible for the majority of the snowfall accumulation which occurred Saturday night. The central pressure never lowered to less than 1005 mb and there was no deepening. However, the pressure gradient was significant northwest of the low, resulting in the strong winds. As with much of this winter, the flow aloft was split with a ridge along the West Coast, a closed low over the Desert Southwest, and confluent flow into the trough over the eastern United States. This low formed as a result of a shortwave trough that came out of western Canada and amplified as it approached the longwave trough.",Storm total snowfall amounts ranged from 2 to 4 inches.,CSV

Ahead of this system deep moisture spread northward across the central Plains. This broad, but persistent area of warm air advection led to increasing showers over Kansas, which moved northward into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa early on the 31st. This initial precipitation was a mix of light rain and snow through mid afternoon. As colder air, associated with a stronger northern stream trough and cold front, started to move into the area late Saturday afternoon and evening the precipitation turned to all snow and began to accumulate. Snow, occasionally moderate, continued into Saturday night diminishing to light snow on Sunday morning, before ending Sunday afternoon. Snowfall of 5 to 9 inches were common across east central and southeast Nebraska, as well as southwest Iowa. As the colder air moved into the area Saturday night winds switched from northeast to northwest and increased. Winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts over 40 mph were common into the day on Sunday that led to considerable blowing and drifting snow. The combination of falling and blowing snow resulted in reduced visibilities and very difficult driving conditions.",Snowfall ranged from 7 to 9 inches across the county including a measured 7 inches in Seward.,CSV

The temperature profile was very marginal, but snow continued to fall through the day. Due to its persistence, some wet accumulations of 1 to 2 inches occurred on grassy surfaces along Highway 81 from Geneva south to Hebron. During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of south central Nebraska for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281. By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into southeast Nebraska. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 4 to 8 inches along and east of Highway 281. The highest amount of 9 inches was measured just north of Aurora. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. Blizzard conditions occurred, at times, with the visibility down to one-quarter mile.

As the colder air moved into the area Saturday night winds switched from northeast to northwest and increased. Winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts over 40 mph were common into the day on Sunday that led to considerable blowing and drifting snow. The combination of falling and blowing snow resulted in reduced visibilities and very difficult driving conditions.

During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of south central Nebraska for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281.

As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph.

Although most of these areas picked up at least a quick inch or so of snow, a narrow corridor generally no more than 30 miles wide received a burst of 2-4 inches, adversely affecting the morning commute especially north of Interstate 80. Conditions were worsened by increasing north wind behind a passing cold front, featuring sustained speeds of generally 20-25 MPH and gusts to over 30 MPH. The center of the main snow band stretched from near Loup City and Arcadia in the northwest, then southeast through the Grand Island, Clay Center and Hebron areas. Within the heart of this swath, a few of the highest measured totals (per a combination of NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers) featured 4.3 at Bruning, 3.6 at Loup City, 3.3 six miles east-southeast of Clay Center, 3.1 at Grand Island airport and 3.0 at Arcadia and Hubbell. On either side of this band, noticeably lower totals were reported at places such as Hastings (1.6) and Geneva (1.5). ||Timing-wise, snow first spread into local counties along and north of the Highway 92  between 7-8 a.m., overtook the Interstate 80 corridor mainly from 8-10 a.m., and thereafter tracked through the southeast quadrant of South Central Nebraska before departing into northern Kansas by mid-day. Turning to the meteorology behind this event, one of the main reasons that snow totals in excess of 1 were initially not anticipated revolved around the fact that there were no obvious strong features such as a pronounced frontogenetic band. However, snowfall rates over the local area were likely enhanced by a pocket of very steep low and especially mid level lapse rates. The main forcing aloft was provided by a quick-moving shortwave trough diving southward across Nebraska out of the Dakotas in a broad northwest flow regime, one of several smaller-scale disturbances passing through the central United States within an expansive large-scale trough that encompassed the majority of the nation. At the surface, a weak surface low pressure system accompanied the leading edge of snow, quickly followed by the cold front that ushered in the gusty north wind. Temperatures across South Central Nebraska generally averaged a few degrees either side of 20 F during this event.",A snowfall total of 3.0 inches was measured in Arcadia.,CSV

Although most of these areas picked up at least a quick inch or so of snow, a narrow corridor generally no more than 30 miles wide received a burst of 2-4 inches, adversely affecting the morning commute especially north of Interstate 80. Conditions were worsened by increasing north wind behind a passing cold front, featuring sustained speeds of generally 20-25 MPH and gusts to over 30 MPH. The center of the main snow band stretched from near Loup City and Arcadia in the northwest, then southeast through the Grand Island, Clay Center and Hebron areas. Within the heart of this swath, a few of the highest measured totals (per a combination of NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers) featured 4.3 at Bruning, 3.6 at Loup City, 3.3 six miles east-southeast of Clay Center, 3.1 at Grand Island airport and 3.0 at Arcadia and Hubbell.

Turning to the meteorology behind this event, one of the main reasons that snow totals in excess of 1 were initially not anticipated revolved around the fact that there were no obvious strong features such as a pronounced frontogenetic band. However, snowfall rates over the local area were likely enhanced by a pocket of very steep low and especially mid level lapse rates.

Unlike the more prolonged event of the preceding weekend, this one was a quick hitter associated with one primary snow band, with most affected areas receiving accumulation for no more than 6-7 hours. Despite this brevity, bursts of moderate to heavy snow combined with sustained north wind of generally 20-25 MPH and gusts up to around 35 MPH to promote a treacherous morning commute along with numerous school closures. The brunt of this system targeted locations north-northeast of a line extending from Gothenburg-Hastings-Hebron, where most places received at least 2-4 inches. However, the epicenter of heaviest accumulations on the order of 4-8 occurred in a generally 30-40 mile wide corridor extending from around Loup City in the northwest, then east-southeast through the St. Paul, Grand Island, Central City, Aurora, Osceola and York areas. Within the heart of this band, a few of the highest measured totals (per a combination of NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers) featured 8.7 four miles north of Aurora, 8.2 at Ravenna, 7.1 in Loup City, 6.1 at Grand Island airport, 6.0 at St. Paul and 5.7 in Osceola. On either side of this primary snow band there was a fairly sharp drop-off in amounts, as evidenced by reports from Ord (3.0) and Genoa (3.0) to the north, and Hastings (1.7) and Hebron (2.8) to the south. ||Breaking down event timing, this generally west-to-east oriented snow band first infiltrated the northwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska between 1-3 a.m. and then steadily intensified through daybreak as it spread east. Generally between 7-9 a.m., the band began sinking southward across the Highway 6 corridor and toward the Kansas border, while gradually weakening and ending from north-to-south and also from west-to-east. By 1130 a.m. the vast majority of the local area was snow-free. On the synoptic and mesoscale aloft, this quick-but-intense event was driven by a rather classic, strongly-forced frontogenetic band evident mainly in the 850-500 millibar layer, but especially centered around 700 millibars. This frontogenetic forcing slid across the heart of Nebraska from northwest-to-southeast, enhanced by a coupled upper jet structure evident at 300 millibars, featuring the exit region of one jet streak nosing in from the Northern Rockies and the entrance region of another jet streak centered over the Upper Midwest. At the surface, gusty north wind across Nebraska was driven by an enhanced pressure gradient between an Arctic high pressure system sliding into the Northern Plains and the leading edges of a cold front charging southward through southern Kansas at daybreak. Temperatures across South Central Nebraska averaged between 15-20 F during the majority of this event.","A snowfall total of 8.2 inches was measured in Ravenna, along with 6.4 inches in Miller.

Although radar data suggested that various other locations likely experienced hail up to around this size, the only ground-truth reports originated from Hastings, Edgar and from the vicinities of Kearney, Sutton and Clay Center. While most of this convection was multicellular and linear, there were a few briefly semi-discrete structures as well. Rainfall amounts under most of the heaviest convection averaged between 0.50 and 1, with only few localized higher exceptions. ||Strong storms first developed into southwestern counties such as Harlan and Franklin between 430-600 p.m. CDT. Then between 6-9 p.m. CDT, a couple of narrow west-to-east arcs of strong storms developed eastward through the Highway 6 and Interstate 80 corridors and lifted slowly north, resulting in the aforementioned hail reports. After nightfall, a few stronger storms lingered over mainly Thayer and Fillmore counties for a time, but these steadily faded with the loss of diurnal heating. In the mid and upper levels, weak forcing was provided by small-scale disturbances shifting into the Central Plains on southerly flow aloft, well-downstream from an expansive large-scale closed low spinning over the Four Corners region. At the surface, afternoon high temperatures only climbed between the mid-60s and low-70s F across most of the area, but the combination of surface dewpoints in the mid-50s and rather cold air aloft (evidenced by 500 millibar temps around -16 C) was sufficient to promote modest surface-based CAPE as high as 500-1000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear only around 30 knots.",,CSV

Unlike the more prolonged event of the preceding weekend, this one was a quick hitter associated with one primary snow band, with most affected areas receiving accumulation for no more than 6-7 hours. Despite this brevity, bursts of moderate to heavy snow combined with sustained north wind of generally 20-25 MPH and gusts up to around 35 MPH to promote a treacherous morning commute along with numerous school closures. The brunt of this system targeted locations north-northeast of a line extending from Gothenburg-Hastings-Hebron, where most places received at least 2-4 inches. However, the epicenter of heaviest accumulations on the order of 4-8 occurred in a generally 30-40 mile wide corridor extending from around Loup City in the northwest, then east-southeast through the St. Paul, Grand Island, Central City, Aurora, Osceola and York areas. Within the heart of this band, a few of the highest measured totals (per a combination of NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers) featured 8.7 four miles north of Aurora, 8.2 at Ravenna, 7.1 in Loup City, 6.1 at Grand Island airport, 6.0 at St. Paul and 5.7 in Osceola. On either side of this primary snow band there was a fairly sharp drop-off in amounts, as evidenced by reports from Ord (3.0) and Genoa (3.0) to the north, and Hastings (1.7) and Hebron (2.8) to the south. ||Breaking down event timing, this generally west-to-east oriented snow band first infiltrated the northwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska between 1-3 a.m. and then steadily intensified through daybreak as it spread east. Generally between 7-9 a.m., the band began sinking southward across the Highway 6 corridor and toward the Kansas border, while gradually weakening and ending from north-to-south and also from west-to-east. By 1130 a.m. the vast majority of the local area was snow-free. On the synoptic and mesoscale aloft, this quick-but-intense event was driven by a rather classic, strongly-forced frontogenetic band evident mainly in the 850-500 millibar layer, but especially centered around 700 millibars. This frontogenetic forcing slid across the heart of Nebraska from northwest-to-southeast, enhanced by a coupled upper jet structure evident at 300 millibars, featuring the exit region of one jet streak nosing in from the Northern Rockies and the entrance region of another jet streak centered over the Upper Midwest. At the surface, gusty north wind across Nebraska was driven by an enhanced pressure gradient between an Arctic high pressure system sliding into the Northern Plains and the leading edges of a cold front charging southward through southern Kansas at daybreak.

Although radar data suggested that various other locations likely experienced hail up to around this size, the only ground-truth reports originated from Hastings, Edgar and from the vicinities of Kearney, Sutton and Clay Center. While most of this convection was multicellular and linear, there were a few briefly semi-discrete structures as well. Rainfall amounts under most of the heaviest convection averaged between 0.50 and 1, with only few localized higher exceptions. ||Strong storms first developed into southwestern counties such as Harlan and Franklin between 430-600 p.m. CDT. Then between 6-9 p.m. CDT, a couple of narrow west-to-east arcs of strong storms developed eastward through the Highway 6 and Interstate 80 corridors and lifted slowly north, resulting in the aforementioned hail reports. After nightfall, a few stronger storms lingered over mainly Thayer and Fillmore counties for a time, but these steadily faded with the loss of diurnal heating.

Otherwise, while having a wide damage path that approached 1/2 mile at times the damage was in the EF0 to EF1 range to structures in its path.  This tornado was visually wide however damage pattern suggested that the wide vortex was likely not entirely on the ground at all times and that smaller vortices were likely responsible for more extensive tree damage noted from time to time within the larger damage path.  It is also surmised that this tornado was actually the result of a 2-3 occlusions which would mean that this tornado could have actually been 2-3 different tornadoes along its path and life cycle however lack of damage indicators and inconclusive radar data keep this a hypothesis.

The temperature profile was very marginal, but snow continued to fall through the day. It did mix with rain at times. Due to its persistence, some wet accumulations of 1 to 2 inches occurred on grassy surfaces. During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of north central Kansas for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281. By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into northeast Kansas. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 2 to 5 inches from eastern Smith into Jewell counties. The highest amount of 5.8 inches was measured at Mankato. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. The visibility was below one mile at times in blowing snow.||The initial wet snow Saturday occurred in warm air advection, in the entrance region of a 150 kt upper-level jet streak. The forcing for precipitation changed, however, as an arctic cold front sagged into Nebraska with lee cyclogenesis occurring ahead of it over southeastern Colorado. As the front continued moving south into Kansas Saturday night, the weak low left Colorado and progressed east along the front. It was located near Kansas City by daybreak Sunday and advanced east into Indiana by sunset. It was this low that was responsible for the majority of the snowfall accumulation which occurred Saturday night. The central pressure never lowered to less than 1005 mb and there was no deepening. However, the pressure gradient was significant northwest of the low, resulting in the strong winds. As with much of this winter, the flow aloft was split with a ridge along the West Coast, a closed low over the Desert Southwest, and confluent flow into the trough over the eastern United States. This low formed as a result of a shortwave trough that came out of western Canada and amplified as it approached the longwave trough.",Storm total snowfall amounts ranged from 3 to 5 inches.,CSV

During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of north central Kansas for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281. By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into northeast Kansas. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 2 to 5 inches from eastern Smith into Jewell counties. The highest amount of 5.8 inches was measured at Mankato. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. The visibility was below one mile at times in blowing snow.||The initial wet snow Saturday occurred in warm air advection, in the entrance region of a 150 kt upper-level jet streak. The forcing for precipitation changed, however, as an arctic cold front sagged into Nebraska with lee cyclogenesis occurring ahead of it over southeastern Colorado. As the front continued moving south into Kansas Saturday night, the weak low left Colorado and progressed east along the front. It was located near Kansas City by daybreak Sunday and advanced east into Indiana by sunset. It was this low that was responsible for the majority of the snowfall accumulation which occurred Saturday night. The central pressure never lowered to less than 1005 mb and there was no deepening. However, the pressure gradient was significant northwest of the low, resulting in the strong winds. As with much of this winter, the flow aloft was split with a ridge along the West Coast, a closed low over the Desert Southwest, and confluent flow into the trough over the eastern United States. This low formed as a result of a shortwave trough that came out of western Canada and amplified as it approached the longwave trough.",Storm total snowfall amounts ranged from 2 to 5 inches.,CSV

The structure itself was pull from the sill plate which had bolts every 6 feet per code. however it appears that an initial failure point was the garage door which faced south and the roof was attached to both the garage and main structure so it appears that a catastrophic failure caused the entire structure to be lifted off its foundation and deposited 50-150 yards to the NE of the foundation.

Within the local area, despite radar data suggesting that isolated instances of severe-criteria hail or wind gusts may have affected parts of Phillips, Smith, and far southern Mitchell counties, the only ground-truth severe weather report consisted of half dollar size north of Burr Oak in Jewell County shortly after 9 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, nearly all affected areas received well under 1, including hardly a drop in Rooks and Osborne counties. ||Breaking down event timing, storms first developed into the Phillips County area along a well-defined surface cold front between 6-7 p.m. CDT, with this primary round of convection then assuming a quasi-linear, multicell mode as it tracked east across mainly northern Smith and Jewell Counties through around 10 p.m. CDT. Between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. CDT, additional convection regenerated over mainly Jewell County while a more isolated strong storm brushed far southern Mitchell County. All in all, this was a fairly standard issue first severe weather event of the season, primarily driven by low-level frontal forcing. Early in the evening, this northeast-southwest oriented front was just starting to enter western portions of the local area, tied into a 998 millibar low pressure center. Although afternoon temperatures ahead of the boundary warmed well into the 80s F, rather meager dewpoints only in the 40s likely precluded a potentially greater severe weather threat. Nonetheless, the presence of steep low-mid level lapse rates promoted sufficient mixed-layer CAPE up to around 1000 J/kg in the presence of decent 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 30-50 knots. In the mid-upper levels, southwesterly flow was fairly modest for this time of year, as the primary large scale trough shifted from the Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains.",,CSV

At first, it appeared storm mode might assume a southwest-northeast oriented line segment, but a more discrete supercell structure quickly evolved as it tracked east down the Highway 36 corridor. As this storm reached eastern Jewell County around 8 p.m. CDT, it began morphing into a more linear structure that expanded southwestward into Mitchell County for a time. However, there were no further severe weather reports as all thunderstorms exited the local area by 930 p.m. CDT, in tandem with the passing cold front. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was provided by the southern reaches of a broad shortwave trough tracking east across the Central and especially Northern Plains, with this trough ushering in increasing west-southwest flow aloft. At the surface, the well-defined, northeast-southwest oriented cold front steadily swept through North Central Kansas during the evening. Ahead of this boundary, afternoon temperatures across most of the local area topped out between 75-80 F as dewpoints rose into the mid-upper 50s on gusty south winds. The presence of a weak surface low and attendant warm front in the immediate area likely contributed to tornado development, as local surface observations revealed a backing of wind direction to southeasterly ahead of the storm.

Although radar data suggested that various other locations likely experienced hail up to around this size, the only ground-truth reports originated from Hastings, Edgar and from the vicinities of Kearney, Sutton and Clay Center. While most of this convection was multicellular and linear, there were a few briefly semi-discrete structures as well. Rainfall amounts under most of the heaviest convection averaged between 0.50 and 1, with only few localized higher exceptions. ||Strong storms first developed into southwestern counties such as Harlan and Franklin between 430-600 p.m. CDT. Then between 6-9 p.m. CDT, a couple of narrow west-to-east arcs of strong storms developed eastward through the Highway 6 and Interstate 80 corridors and lifted slowly north, resulting in the aforementioned hail reports. After nightfall, a few stronger storms lingered over mainly Thayer and Fillmore counties for a time, but these steadily faded with the loss of diurnal heating. In the mid and upper levels, weak forcing was provided by small-scale disturbances shifting into the Central Plains on southerly flow aloft, well-downstream from an expansive large-scale closed low spinning over the Four Corners region. At the surface, afternoon high temperatures only climbed between the mid-60s and low-70s F across most of the area, but the combination of surface dewpoints in the mid-50s and rather cold air aloft (evidenced by 500 millibar temps around -16 C) was sufficient to promote modest surface-based CAPE as high as 500-1000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear only around 30 knots.",Penny size hail fell on the west side of Hastings.,CSV

Unlike the more prolonged event of the preceding weekend, this one was a quick hitter associated with one primary snow band, with most affected areas receiving accumulation for no more than 6-7 hours. Despite this brevity, bursts of moderate to heavy snow combined with sustained north wind of generally 20-25 MPH and gusts up to around 35 MPH to promote a treacherous morning commute along with numerous school closures. The brunt of this system targeted locations north-northeast of a line extending from Gothenburg-Hastings-Hebron, where most places received at least 2-4 inches. However, the epicenter of heaviest accumulations on the order of 4-8 occurred in a generally 30-40 mile wide corridor extending from around Loup City in the northwest, then east-southeast through the St. Paul, Grand Island, Central City, Aurora, Osceola and York areas. Within the heart of this band, a few of the highest measured totals (per a combination of NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers) featured 8.7 four miles north of Aurora, 8.2 at Ravenna, 7.1 in Loup City, 6.1 at Grand Island airport, 6.0 at St. Paul and 5.7 in Osceola.

Unlike the more prolonged event of the preceding weekend, this one was a quick hitter associated with one primary snow band, with most affected areas receiving accumulation for no more than 6-7 hours. Despite this brevity, bursts of moderate to heavy snow combined with sustained north wind of generally 20-25 MPH and gusts up to around 35 MPH to promote a treacherous morning commute along with numerous school closures. The brunt of this system targeted locations north-northeast of a line extending from Gothenburg-Hastings-Hebron, where most places received at least 2-4 inches. However, the epicenter of heaviest accumulations on the order of 4-8 occurred in a generally 30-40 mile wide corridor extending from around Loup City in the northwest, then east-southeast through the St. Paul, Grand Island, Central City, Aurora, Osceola and York areas. Within the heart of this band, a few of the highest measured totals (per a combination of NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers) featured 8.7 four miles north of Aurora, 8.2 at Ravenna, 7.1 in Loup City, 6.1 at Grand Island airport, 6.0 at St. Paul and 5.7 in Osceola. On either side of this primary snow band there was a fairly sharp drop-off in amounts, as evidenced by reports from Ord (3.0) and Genoa (3.0) to the north, and Hastings (1.7) and Hebron (2.8) to the south. ||Breaking down event timing, this generally west-to-east oriented snow band first infiltrated the northwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska between 1-3 a.m. and then steadily intensified through daybreak as it spread east. Generally between 7-9 a.m., the band began sinking southward across the Highway 6 corridor and toward the Kansas border, while gradually weakening and ending from north-to-south and also from west-to-east. By 1130 a.m. the vast majority of the local area was snow-free. On the synoptic and mesoscale aloft, this quick-but-intense event was driven by a rather classic, strongly-forced frontogenetic band evident mainly in the 850-500 millibar layer, but especially centered around 700 millibars. This frontogenetic forcing slid across the heart of Nebraska from northwest-to-southeast, enhanced by a coupled upper jet structure evident at 300 millibars, featuring the exit region of one jet streak nosing in from the Northern Rockies and the entrance region of another jet streak centered over the Upper Midwest. At the surface, gusty north wind across Nebraska was driven by an enhanced pressure gradient between an Arctic high pressure system sliding into the Northern Plains and the leading edges of a cold front charging southward through southern Kansas at daybreak. Temperatures across South Central Nebraska averaged between 15-20 F during the majority of this event.","A snowfall total of 7.1 inches was reported 2 miles northwest of Rockville, along with 6.2 inches in Loup City.

A strong cold front moved through the area overnight on the 26th pushing this moisture into the mid levels. Precipitation fell behind this front as isentropic lift increased overnight. A wide range of precipitation fell overnight into the next morning with rain changing over to a mix of sleet, freezing rain, and snow. Over a quarter of an inch of ice was reported across portions of south central Kansas stretching westward as far as Liberal to Dodge City to Great Bend. A mix of sleet and snow was reported west of this line with minimal accumulations by the afternoon of the 27th. Periodic episodes of light freezing rain continued across portions of south central Kansas over the remainder of the 27th through the 29th with light freezing drizzle at times across the remainder of the forecast area. Another strong upper level shortwave moved through the area the night of the 29th into the morning of the 30th bringing another round of precipitation across western Kansas. Additional freezing rain, sleet, and snow were reported across central and south central Kansas with sleet and snow reported elsewhere. Up to 3 inches was reported across portions of west central Kansas with lesser amounts as you headed eastward.

A wide range of precipitation fell overnight into the next morning with rain changing over to a mix of sleet, freezing rain, and snow. Over a quarter of an inch of ice was reported across portions of south central Kansas stretching westward as far as Liberal to Dodge City to Great Bend. A mix of sleet and snow was reported west of this line with minimal accumulations by the afternoon of the 27th.

According to a trained spotter two miles southwest of Edison, an unofficial rain total of 5 inches poured down in a 90-minute span between 3:30-5:00 p.m. CDT, washing out part of a driveway. In Edison itself, the NWS cooperative observer recorded a slightly lower storm total of 3.74, but this was still more than enough rain in a short time to cause significant flooding of several roads and some structures.

Within this area, an initially weak cluster of convection rapidly intensified between 3-6 p.m. CDT, morphing into a nearly solid, southward-sinking line of slow-moving strong to severe storms. The primary synoptic scale trigger for this event was a very slow-moving, southwest-to-northeast oriented surface cold front roughly bisecting Nebraska during the afternoon and evening. Considerable moisture pooled in the vicinity of this boundary, featuring surface dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s F and precipitable water values averaging 1.50-2.00.

The first episode was associated with a couple supercells that formed near McCook, Nebraska the prior evening. These storms evolved into a small multicell cluster that was joined by a few other storms as it moved southeast across north-central Kansas between midnight at 3 a.m. CST. This small cluster was mostly sub-severe, producing penny size hail and measured winds of 50-55 mph in a few spots. However, it did produce a severe wind gust of 61 mph in Logan. Later in the day, between 5 and 6 pm CST, several thunderstorms formed over Rooks, Phillips, and Smith Counties. They quickly congealed into a multicell cluster. This cluster remained quasi-stationary between 5:30 and 8:30 p.m., with the most persistent heavy rain over southeastern Phillips and northeastern Rooks Counties. Three to six inches of rain were measured in this short time span and this resulted in flash flooding, with numerous gravel roads under water and some washed out in spots. One of these storms did produce hail to the size of quarters in Stockton, which is in Rooks County.||The overnight storms occurred near a dissipating frontal boundary, with no forcing aloft. The late afternoon and evening storms formed along a weak cold front that had dropped through Nebraska, during the day, and was slowing its forward progress over north central Kansas. In the upper levels, a broad ridge encompassed the Plains atop a subtropical high over the Southern Plains. The Central Plains were on the southern fringe of the Westerlies. Surface temperatures in advance of the storms were in the mid 80s, with dewpoints near 70. With mid-level lapse rates of 7.5 deg C/km, MLCAPE values were between 2000 and 3000 J/kg.

Between 9-10 p.m. CDT, some of this weaker convection merged with a stronger storm tracking northeast out of Ellis County, eventually producing the Osborne wind damage. Once this severe storm dissipated, only weak activity lingered thereafter, with all of North Central Kansas storm-free by 2 a.m. CDT. In the mid-upper levels, a seasonably-typical quasi-zonal flow pattern was in place over Kansas, containing weak, embedded shortwave disturbances along the northern periphery of a subtropical high centered over Texas. At the surface, afternoon/evening convection within northern and western Kansas was largely tied to convergence along a quasi-stationary front. Despite warm mid level air with 700-millibar temperatures running 12-14 C, the presence of a well-mixed, hot and moist airmass featuring afternoon temperatures in the 90s F and dewpoints generally between 65-70 F was enough to breach the cap and result in vigorous, outflow-dominant multicell storms. Around the time of the Osborne wind damage, mesoscale parameters featured at least 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",,CSV

While additional non-severe storms lingered over northeast counties such as Nance, Merrick and Polk past the midnight hour, all of South Central Nebraska was storm-free by 2:30 a.m. CDT.||This was a somewhat unusual severe weather setup by late-August standards, as a seasonably well-defined surface low and attendant eastward-arcing warm front became established over the heart of South Central Nebraska during the afternoon and evening. Although mid/upper level flow wasn't overly strong, a fairly compact vort max tracked over central Nebraska, well to the north of an expansive ridge anchored over northern Mexico. In addition, a seasonably-strong southerly low level jet ramped up to around 40 knots over much of central and eastern Nebraska by early evening. The combination of this low level jet and the underlying surface warm front yielded an impressive 30 knots of 0-1 kilometer low level wind shear around the time of the Merrick County wind damage. Other early-evening mesoscale parameters were more modest, including roughly 1000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",Wind gusts estimated near 70 MPH blew over an irrigation pivot and resulted in significant crop damage within a localized area.,CSV

Although widespread precipitation affected the area for several hours on this Friday night into early Saturday morning, all severe wind reports occurred between 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. CDT as a north-to-south oriented bowing segment charged through. Along and near the leading edge of the surging outflow, wind gusts around 60 MPH were reported near Gibbon, in rural southeastern Adams and southwestern Clay counties, and also near Superior. Well-behind this bowing line, severe gusts associated with a well-defined mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) brought down numerous tree limbs in Cozad. Although there were no confirmed tornadoes, the presence of seasonably-strong low level shear aided the development of a few brief, radar-indicated rotational signatures, one of which prompted a short-fused Tornado Warning for southern Adams County. Rainfall-wise, though many areas roughly southwest of a Ravenna-Hastings-Hebron line picked up 1-2, the fairly progressive nature of the heaviest cores held flooding issues to a minimum, save for typical short-term street flooding in communities such as Elm Creek. ||Timing-wise, most of South Central Nebraska remained rain-free until after dark, save for a narrow band of weak convection that lifted through several northern and eastern counties during the early evening. However, a pair of expanding severe storm clusters gradually took aim on the local area as they approached from southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas, eventually merging into an organized mesoscale convective system (MCS) that surged into western portions of South Central Nebraska between 10-11 p.m. CDT. By the midnight to 1 a.m. CDT time frame, the primary bowing segment raced through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 before departing into southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas. In its wake, a large shield of light to moderate rain persisted across the local area for most of the night. In the mid/upper levels, this event featured slightly-stronger-than-average forcing by early August standards, as a well-defined lead disturbance moved out of the Central Rockies into the Central Plains in quasi-zonal flow aloft, downstream from a larger scale parent trough centered over Nevada. By the time the MCS entered the local area, convection was being sustained/enhanced by a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet evident at 850 millibars. At the surface, South Central Nebraska featured a light easterly flow regime, to the north of a quasi-stationary front loosely draped across the southern half of Kansas. Around the time of the severe wind reports, mesoscale parameters featured 1000-2000 J/kg most unstable CAPE, deep layer wind shear of 30-40 knots and rather strong 0-1 kilometer low level shear of 20-30 knots.",,CSV

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear. During the night, widespread weak convection persisted within the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet.",Wind gusts were estimated to be near 60 MPH.,CSV

The first severe storm of the afternoon developed near Kearney around 5 p.m. CDT, and was likely the most prolific hail-producer as it slowly drifted north-northwest through central and northwest Buffalo County for nearly two hours. Just north of Kearney, a few vehicles slid off of Highway 10 as it became hail-covered and slick. This storm also produced the largest reported hail of the day (2) north of Riverdale. Between 6-9 p.m. CDT, several other storms either flared up over various parts of the area or pushed northward out of Kansas, with quarter size hail reported near the state line south of Red Cloud and also in Wood River. Even though the mesoscale environment was potentially supportive of a somewhat greater severe weather threat, the fairly rapid development of plentiful convection and resultant storm-scale outflow interference likely mitigated this. With the loss of diurnal heating, storms steadily weakened and diminished in coverage within a few hours after nightfall. Although most affected areas received less than 1 of rainfall, much of northern Kearney County along with adjacent portions of southeast Buffalo, southwest Hall and northwest Adams counties received higher amounts to around 2. ||In the mid-upper levels, the primary player was an expansive closed low churning slowly eastward through eastern Colorado, with several smaller-scale disturbances shifting northward into the Central Plains along its eastern flank. At the surface, there were no distinct synoptic features within South Central Nebraska, only fairly weak, broad low pressure and prevailing light southerly to easterly breezes. Despite afternoon temperatures only rising into the low-70s F, the combination of surface dewpoints in the low to mid-50s and notably cold air aloft (evidenced by 500 millibar temps around -18 C) yielded surface-based CAPE around 1000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",,CSV

This storm yielded several reports of large hail and also the first tornado of 2015 within this six-county North Central Kansas area, an EF-0 that touched down three miles north of Smith Center and tracked for about one mile, damaging the roof of an outbuilding. Prior to this brief tornado, there had been several reports of a funnel cloud or multiple funnels as the storm traversed west-central Smith County. For most of its path, this supercell was primarily a hail-producer, as quarter size stones fell in Lebanon, Burr Oak and Formoso, and larger stones up to golf ball size rained down on Mankato for several minutes. ||Focusing on event timing, this storm initiated over the Smith-Phillips County line around 6 p.m. CDT, just ahead of an approaching cold front. At first, it appeared storm mode might assume a southwest-northeast oriented line segment, but a more discrete supercell structure quickly evolved as it tracked east down the Highway 36 corridor. As this storm reached eastern Jewell County around 8 p.m. CDT, it began morphing into a more linear structure that expanded southwestward into Mitchell County for a time. However, there were no further severe weather reports as all thunderstorms exited the local area by 930 p.m. CDT, in tandem with the passing cold front. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was provided by the southern reaches of a broad shortwave trough tracking east across the Central and especially Northern Plains, with this trough ushering in increasing west-southwest flow aloft. At the surface, the well-defined, northeast-southwest oriented cold front steadily swept through North Central Kansas during the evening. Ahead of this boundary, afternoon temperatures across most of the local area topped out between 75-80 F as dewpoints rose into the mid-upper 50s on gusty south winds. The presence of a weak surface low and attendant warm front in the immediate area likely contributed to tornado development, as local surface observations revealed a backing of wind direction to southeasterly ahead of the storm. As for basic severe weather parameters, mixed-layer CAPE values peaked in the 1000-1500 J/kg range in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 40-50 knots.",,CSV

With no cap in place, scattered thunderstorms began developing as early as the noon hour over north central Kansas. Most storms rapidly became supercellular. These supercells rapidly lifted north into south central Nebraska and began producing severe weather by 330 p.m. CDT. Most of the tornadoes occurred over Nuckolls and Thayer counties. One tornado did occur over Adams county and a brief spin-up also occurred over Hall county. Eventually, an MCS developed. The leading edge of the cold pool becoming stationary. New storms repeatedly developed over north central Kansas and lifted northeast along the boundary, through Nuckolls and Thayer counties and further downstream into southeastern Nebraska. Cell training produced a swath of 5-11 inches of rain over portions of Nuckolls and Thayer counties. The highest amount reported was 10.91 inches just west of Hebron. This amount of rainfall in 24 hours typically occurs once in 1,000 years at any given location, or stated another way, has a .1% chance of occurrence in a given 24 hour period. Cooperative observers in Hebron and Superior reported 8.59 and 7.13 inches, respectively. These were the highest 24-hour rainfall amounts ever recorded at these locations, dating back to 1893. Flash flooding damaged roads and some bridges were washed out. U.S. Highways 81 and 136 were closed for a time due to the flooding.||A complex low pressure system extended from the Canadian Prairies into the western United States. These storms developed in the warm sector, far away from any discernible surface boundaries. However, an axis of confluence was present over north central Kansas. A deep upper-level trough was over the western U.S., with a ridge over the East. In the southwest flow between these features, a shortwave trough was lifting through the Central Plains. These storms formed in the southeast quadrant of the associated vorticity maximum. Around the time thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower 70s with dewpoints in the lower 60s, resulting in low cloud bases. Even at mid-afternoon, cloud bases were only 2000-2500 feet. The surface conditions and mid-level lapse rates of 7 degrees C/km resulted in SBCAPE around 1500 J/kg. Deep layer shear was only 25-30 knots. However, low-level wind fields were strong with 40-45 knots at 850 mb. This resulted in large hodographs with 0-1 km SRH values of 200-250 m2/s2, and 0-3 km SRH of 250-300 m2/s2. Combined with low cloud bases, this created a favorable environment for supercells and tornadoes.","This tornado touched down about 3 miles south of Roseland, clipping the east side of town before lifting just north-northeast of town. This tornado was rated an EF1, with an estimated peak wind speed of 110 MPH. The most widespread damage from this tornado was on the east side of town, and while several homes and outbuildings sustained damage, 2 sustained considerable damage. One of those homes slide from its foundation and another lost its entire roof structure. A large metal building with wood post frame construction was destroyed and tree damage was widespread throughout town. The tornado traveled just a few hundred feet east of Silver Lake School.",CSV

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear. During the night, widespread weak convection persisted within the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet.","A small stretch of Highway 21 was completely covered in hail.

With storms ranging in character from semi-discrete to clusters and line segments, they primarily produced hail up to around quarter size, along with heavy rain. Although convection affected parts of several counties at some point during the night, the majority of ground-truth severe weather reports emanated from Adams and Clay counties, including quarter size hail on the east side of Hastings, hail up to golf ball size in Clay Center, and several hours later, a combination of quarter size hail and estimated 60 MPH winds six miles east-southeast of Clay Center. Rainfall-wise, the big story of the night was a concentrated swath of generally 1.50-3.00 that fell over southern Hall/northern Adams counties, southeastward through most of Clay, Fillmore and northern Thayer counties. Within this corridor, a few of the highest overnight totals from NeRAIN observers included 3.13 near Alexandria and 3.00 a few miles northwest of Hastings. As a result, minor flooding affected several creeks and streams and some roadways. In fact, the southbound lanes of Highway 281 in far-southern Hall County were closed for a few hours during the night due to flooding. Although this generally minor flooding subsided during the day of the 4th, unfortunately many of these same areas would soon be drenched with another 2-4 on the evening of the 4th into the morning of the 5th, resulting in 36-hour totals of 3-7 and a more serious, widespread flooding situation (please refer to the separate June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. severe weather episode for further details). ||Breaking down the overall event timing, all convection through the pre-dark hours focused to the south over northern Kansas. Then, between 10 p.m.-midnight CDT, storms began developing northward into the southern two rows of South Central Nebraska counties, largely in response to a strengthening, northward-lifting low level jet. Over the course of the next several hours, numerous strong to occasionally severe storms continued spreading north and east across the area, with half dollar size hail reported as far north as southern Greeley County. Within the aforementioned primary zone of heavy rain, the majority fell between 2:30-6:00 a.m. CDT. As one area of storms was in the process of exiting eastern counties of the local area around sunrise, a separate, quick-moving line of non-severe convection moved in from the southwest, sweeping across most of South Central Nebraska between 5-9 a.m. CDT. Although a few storms persisted here and there through late-morning, most places began a brief respite before the next round of evening/overnight storms arrived. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale situation: with a generally west-east oriented surface front residing near the Nebraska-Kansas border through the night, seasonably-strong instability and shear in place, and a strengthening 30-40 knot southerly low level jet taking direct aim on the local area, this was a well-anticipated nocturnal convective flare-up. On the large scale, the Central Plains was under broad west-southwest flow aloft, well-downstream from a large trough centered over the West Coast. At the time of the first severe-criteria hail reports around 11:30 p.m. CDT, the environment featured most-unstable CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg and 0-6 kilometer deep-layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",Dime to quarter size hail occurred at Dove Hill Avenue and Highway 30.,CSV

The leading storm intensified and became a supercell. This cluster moved southeast across portions of Rooks and Osborne counties through 5:30 p.m. CST, continuing to be anchored by the supercell. This supercell produced prolific amounts of hail along its path, covering the ground in some areas. The largest reported was the size of baseballs near the town of Speed, in Phillips County. Significant damage occurred to the roof, siding, windows, and several vehicles on one farm. Radar signatures strongly suggested this storm may have produced hail of similar size in other areas, but no reports were received due to low population. This storm also damaged trees in southwest Osborne County. Between 5 and 6 p.m. CST, a broken line of thunderstorms dropped out of Nebraska into north central Kansas. A couple of these storms were severe as well. One was a supercell that tracked through Phillips and Osborne counties, a little north of the previous storm. This storm produced hail to at least the size of golf balls. The other storm raked across Jewell county between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. CST. This storm was responsible for multiple reports of measured winds in excess of 65 MPH, including one of 80 MPH. Hail was reported up to 1.5 inches in diameter.

Shortly after midnight, scattered showers and generally weak thunderstorms developed over south central Nebraska. Most of this activity occurred east of Highway 281, between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. CST. The small storm that produced this damage moved into southwestern Hamilton County from northwestern Clay County shortly before 3 am CST. It was at 3 a.m. that a very small downburst occurred just southwest and west of Giltner. These were outflow winds immediately ahead of the storm. Grain bins were damaged as a result, with two having roofs pushed in. Another grain bin in a different but nearby location was removed from its location and deposited in a field. This downburst was very brief. Radar indicated strong outflow winds of 50 knots at the lowest elevation angle, at the time of the event, and there was no indication of these winds 5 minutes before or 5 minutes after.||These storms developed in an area of warm air advection associated with a 45 knot low-level jet, in the warm sector of low pressure over the Dakotas. A lee-side trough extended from this low across western Nebraska and Kansas. The flow aloft was moderately amplified with a ridge over the Plains and a trough along the West Coast. Mid-level winds were very weak over Nebraska, on the order of 5-10 knots. Surface temperatures were in the lower to middle 70s, with dewpoints in the 60s.

Scattered elevated showers, and a few embedded, weak thunderstorms, progressed through south central Nebraska during the morning and afternoon hours. Much of the area was cloudy through early afternoon, as low stratus lingered from the nighttime hours. Between noon and 1 p.m. CST, the southernmost thunderstorm emerged into Webster County. This storm rapidly intensified and became an isolated, classic supercell as it emerged from an area of cloudiness into sunshine and moved crossed Nuckolls and Thayer Counties. This area was the only portion of south central Nebraska that had seen prolonged sunshine. This storm produced very large hail over Thayer County, and those reports were on the fringe of the most intense core. Given the impressive radar signatures, hail larger than tennis balls may have fallen from west-to-east across central Thayer County. However, the core tracked just north of Highway 136, where population is extremely low.

As the storm skirted to the north of Hebron, some wind damage occurred associated with the rear flank downdraft. This storm occurred early in the afternoon and exited Thayer county by 230 p.m. CST. Between 4 and 9 p.m. CST, other storms developed over south central Nebraska. While most were not severe, one storm that developed over Adams County produced hail up to the size of golf balls in Hastings.||South central Nebraska was behind a weak cold front that had moved through Sunday. As the day progressed, this front appeared to lift north back into Nebraska, as differential heating occurred between the cloudy and sunny areas. The equipment at the Hebron airport measured temperatures in the upper 80s and dewpoints in the lower 70s within the storm inflow. Combined with mid-level lapse rates between 7 and 7.5 deg C/km, the resulting MLCAPE was around 2000 J/kg. 0-3 km SRH was between 200 and 300 m2/s2, with deep layer shear 45 to 50 knots. Shear and instability were similar into the evening hours, even though temperatures had cooled into the middle 70s. In the upper-levels, a low was over the Canadian Prairies with a broad trough underneath over the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. Nebraska was on the southern fringe of the Westerlies.",,CSV

Thunderstorm activity was continuous, in some shape or form, from late morning all the way through midnight. The hailers began early, as a short line segment of individual storms developed over Custer and Dawson counties. The southernmost storms in this line produced some one inch hail over northeast Dawson and northwest Buffalo counties just prior to noon. Those storm gradually dissipated during the early afternoon hours, but other very isolated storms did form behind the dissipating storms through mid-afternoon. By 5 p.m. CST, three discrete storms were in progress over parts of Valley, Sherman, and Buffalo counties. They had intensified, become supercells, and were severe. These storms propagated southeastward over the following couple hours, affecting parts of Howard, Hall, and Hamilton counties as well. Each of these storms produced swaths of hail up to the size of golf balls. Some storms produced so much hail that the ground appeared white. A mesonet site in Farwell, in western Howard County, measured winds of 59 MPH as well. Another line of multicell storms formed from northwest to southeast behind these storms. The strongest storm within this line developed over Howard County around 9 p.m. CST. It tracked southeast from near St. Paul, across Aurora, and all the way down to Hebron, exiting Thayer County shortly after midnight. This storm produced one inch hail in several locations along its path. Cell training resulted in a swath of two to three inches of rain across Valley, Howard, Merrick, northern Hamilton, and York counties. The highest total was 2.90 in Scotia, in Greeley County. One of the isolated storms that developed in the middle of the afternoon was a slow-moving supercell (right-mover) that propagated into Furnas County. As this storm headed southeast, another small storm briefly developed and moved into the northwest corner of the county before dissipating. Both of these storms affected the Cambridge area between 3 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. CST, dropping two to three inches of rain. This resulted in a flash flood, with several inches of water flowing across Highway 6.||Given the sustained and persistent thunderstorm activity, the lack of forcing was very surprising. A modified continental air mass was in place. Weak high pressure was over the region to begin the day. As the high departed, a surface trough migrated into Nebraska, ahead of a strong cold front that was dropping through the Dakotas. In the upper-levels, a broad trough was over the central United States. The band of Westerlies was north of Nebraska, associated with the approaching front. There was a weak shortwave trough approaching by early evening, but it was still upstream over Montana and Wyoming. During peak heating, surface temperatures were in the 80s, with dewpoints in the upper 50s and lower 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite this MLCAPE varied between 1000 and 2000 J/kg.

A wide range of precipitation fell overnight into the next morning with rain changing over to a mix of sleet, freezing rain, and snow. Over a quarter of an inch of ice was reported across portions of south central Kansas stretching westward as far as Liberal to Dodge City to Great Bend. A mix of sleet and snow was reported west of this line with minimal accumulations by the afternoon of the 27th. Periodic episodes of light freezing rain continued across portions of south central Kansas over the remainder of the 27th through the 29th with light freezing drizzle at times across the remainder of the forecast area. Another strong upper level shortwave moved through the area the night of the 29th into the morning of the 30th bringing another round of precipitation across western Kansas.

Thunderstorm activity was continuous, in some shape or form, from late morning all the way through midnight. The hailers began early, as a short line segment of individual storms developed over Custer and Dawson counties. The southernmost storms in this line produced some one inch hail over northeast Dawson and northwest Buffalo counties just prior to noon. Those storm gradually dissipated during the early afternoon hours, but other very isolated storms did form behind the dissipating storms through mid-afternoon. By 5 p.m. CST, three discrete storms were in progress over parts of Valley, Sherman, and Buffalo counties. They had intensified, become supercells, and were severe. These storms propagated southeastward over the following couple hours, affecting parts of Howard, Hall, and Hamilton counties as well. Each of these storms produced swaths of hail up to the size of golf balls. Some storms produced so much hail that the ground appeared white. A mesonet site in Farwell, in western Howard County, measured winds of 59 MPH as well. Another line of multicell storms formed from northwest to southeast behind these storms. The strongest storm within this line developed over Howard County around 9 p.m. CST. It tracked southeast from near St. Paul, across Aurora, and all the way down to Hebron, exiting Thayer County shortly after midnight. This storm produced one inch hail in several locations along its path. Cell training resulted in a swath of two to three inches of rain across Valley, Howard, Merrick, northern Hamilton, and York counties. The highest total was 2.90 in Scotia, in Greeley County. One of the isolated storms that developed in the middle of the afternoon was a slow-moving supercell (right-mover) that propagated into Furnas County. As this storm headed southeast, another small storm briefly developed and moved into the northwest corner of the county before dissipating. Both of these storms affected the Cambridge area between 3 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. CST, dropping two to three inches of rain. This resulted in a flash flood, with several inches of water flowing across Highway 6.||Given the sustained and persistent thunderstorm activity, the lack of forcing was very surprising. A modified continental air mass was in place. Weak high pressure was over the region to begin the day. As the high departed, a surface trough migrated into Nebraska, ahead of a strong cold front that was dropping through the Dakotas. In the upper-levels, a broad trough was over the central United States. The band of Westerlies was north of Nebraska, associated with the approaching front.

While there were many reports of wall clouds and funnel clouds, these storms did not produce much severe weather. Most storms exhibited classic supercell characteristics on radar, with some supercells splitting. The only confirmed severe weather was 1.5 inch hail in Red Cloud, which is in Webster county, and a measured wind gust of 67 mph near the town of Chester, in southern Thayer county.||These storms formed north of a cold front that moved through the previous night and became stationary over northern Kansas. In the upper-levels, a subtropical high was over Texas, with a ridge extending north to Minnesota. Troughs were along the East Coast and over the western United States. A shortwave trough was embedded, in the western trough, from Montana south to Utah. Surface temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the upper 60s and lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were low, resulting in MLCAPE between 1000 and 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was 30-35 knots. Low-level (0-3 km) SRH was between 150 and 300 m2/s2. However, 0-1 km shear was less than optimal, between 10 and 15 knots. While this environment was supportive of supercells, the lack of low-level shear may have contributed to the lack of tornadoes.",This gust was measured by the PECAN project team.,CSV

An outbreak of tornadic supercells occurred over western Kansas late Monday afternoon and evening. One of these supercells, with a history of producing at least one tornado, exited Kansas and crossed into eastern Furnas county around 7:30 pm CST. This storm produced an EF-1 tornado with a track nearly 13 miles in length over southeastern and east-central Furnas county. The storm ceased to be tornadic as a broken line of faster-moving thunderstorms caught up to and absorbed it. This was the first tornado for the Hastings County Warning Area since the EF-0 that occurred near Ayr on November 5, 2000. This was the first November tornado for the entire state of Nebraska since the Cass County EF-0 on November 17, 2003. About an hour after the storm merger occurred, this storm produced one inch hail a little west of Holdrege. ||This storm, and all the other nearby tornadic storms, developed as lee cyclogenesis occurred and a warm front lifted north to the northwest Kansas-southwest Nebraska border. A cold front emerged from the Rockies and crossed south central Nebraska Monday night into Tuesday morning. This advected much colder temperatures into the region. As the 992 mb low emerged into Kansas during the day, a narrow band of snow developed around its northern and western periphery. The result was three to six inches of snow over portions of south central Nebraska, with the highest amounts over Dawson and Gosper counties.||Within the environment that produced the tornadic supercells, temperatures surged into the lower 70s, with dewpoints near 50. Mid-level lapse rates were poor which resulted in MUCAPE no greater than 500 J/kg. However, deep layer shear was 50-55 kts with 0-1 km SRH 250 m2/s2, more than sufficient for rotating storms and tornadoes. In the upper-levels, a trough was over the western United States Monday, with a ridge over the East. A closed low was in the base of the trough and was advancing through the Desert Southwest. This low then tracked across the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and into southern Kansas Tuesday. By daybreak Wednesday, this low was near Topeka. This was a strong system with the surface low as deep as 989 mb. By Wednesday morning, the upper-level jet streak that rotated around the base of the low had intensified to 150 kts.","This tornado crossed into Nebraska southeast of Beaver City and traveled north-northeast across rural areas of Furnas County south of Hollinger. Damage along the path was primarily to trees, power poles, some signs, outbuildings and small farm machinery. The tornado damaged mainly power poles and trees south of Highway 89. After it crossed Highway 89, the tornado clipped a barn and farm storage area northeast of Hollinger.

Roads became ice covered and treacherous for drivers.||A cold front had crossed south central Nebraska the day before, allowing an unseasonably cold Canadian air mass to seep southward into the region. Arctic high pressure was 1041 mb over Montana. In the upper-levels, a positively tilted trough extended from Hudson Bay southwest into the western United States, with a low over Utah and Nevada. Southwest flow extended from the Desert Southwest all the way into eastern Canada. A ridge was over the Gulf of Mexico.",Reports from the area included trace amounts of sleet and ice accumulations of less than 0.20.,CSV

While the majority of locations reported amounts between 1 and 2.5 inches, several counties primarily along and south of Highway 6 received locally higher totals of 3-4, marking the biggest snowfall of the early winter season for places such as Hastings. According to a combination of NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS and NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 4.0 at Geneva and Lawrence, 3.5 at several locations including two miles east-northeast of Franklin, four miles southwest of Bladen and eight miles northwest of Superior, 3.3 at Cambridge and 3.0 at Clay Center and Harlan County Lake. On the lower end of the spectrum, far northern counties (especially north of Highway 92) averaged under 1. All in all, this was a fairly low-impact event, especially given that winds averaged near-to-below 10 MPH and the snow was fairly wet in nature given surface temperatures in the mid-to-upper 20s. In fact, many folks welcomed this snow as it set the stage for the first white Christmas much of the area had seen in three years.||Timing-wise, this was clearly an overnight/early morning event for most of South Central Nebraska. The first snowflakes pushed into western portions of the area between 12-2 AM, with the leading edge of steady snow reaching the Highway 281 corridor around 3 AM and finally the Highway 81 corridor between 4-5 AM.

More specifically, a southwest-to-northeast oriented snow band overspread locations primarily northwest of a line from Beaver City-Kearney-Wolbach during the 9 PM-midnight time frame before eventually departing far northern counties such as Valley/Greeley between 3-5 AM on the 26th. While most counties within this snow zone accumulated no more than 1 to 2.5, a more concentrated swath of 3-5 targeted much of Sherman/Valley/Greeley counties. According to NWS cooperative observers, some of the highest totals featured: 4.5 at Ord, 3.5 at Arcadia and Loup City and 3.1 at Greeley. Fortunately, winds were not a major issue, averaging only 10-15 MPH from an east-northeast direction. In addition to the aforementioned round of convection and the primary snow band, there was yet another round of precipitation worthy of mention: mainly between 11 PM-4 AM, areas of steady light freezing drizzle developed within several of the same central and eastern counties that earlier had experienced thunderstorm activity. This freezing drizzle coated all elevated surfaces with a light glaze in places such as Hastings and Grand Island. However, somewhat ironically, many roadways did not become overly-slick from this freezing drizzle given that the ground was already textured by the earlier occurrence of graupel/snow pellets.||In the mid and upper levels, this complex, messy and memorable holiday weather event occurred under pronounced southwesterly flow aloft on the downstream side of an expansive, large-scale trough centered over the western United States. On the smaller scale, forcing was provided by a lead shortwave disturbance ejecting out from the parent trough through western Nebraska into South Dakota. In the lower levels at 850 millibars, precipitation development and intensity (especially the convection) was aided by a rather strong southeasterly low level jet that ramped up to around 40 knots and interacted with weak elevated instability. The complexity of the varied precipitation types over South Central Nebraska was very evident in the 850 millibar temperature gradient, as the 0 C line roughly bisected the heart of the area from southwest-to-northeast throughout this event, with southeastern counties averaging a few degrees above freezing at this level and northwestern counties a few degrees below freezing.

These storms, which featured frequent lightning at times, produced a varied mix of sleet, graupel (snow pellets), freezing rain and light snow. While most places saw fairly minimal accumulation of this wintry mix, the NWS office in Hastings tallied 1.1 of graupel as thunderstorms persisted for nearly two hours.

More specifically, a southwest-to-northeast oriented snow band overspread locations primarily northwest of a line from Beaver City-Kearney-Wolbach during the 9 PM-midnight time frame before eventually departing far northern counties such as Valley/Greeley between 3-5 AM on the 26th. While most counties within this snow zone accumulated no more than 1 to 2.5, a more concentrated swath of 3-5 targeted much of Sherman/Valley/Greeley counties.

Fortunately, winds were not a major issue, averaging only 10-15 MPH from an east-northeast direction. In addition to the aforementioned round of convection and the primary snow band, there was yet another round of precipitation worthy of mention: mainly between 11 PM-4 AM, areas of steady light freezing drizzle developed within several of the same central and eastern counties that earlier had experienced thunderstorm activity. This freezing drizzle coated all elevated surfaces with a light glaze in places such as Hastings and Grand Island. However, somewhat ironically, many roadways did not become overly-slick from this freezing drizzle given that the ground was already textured by the earlier occurrence of graupel/snow pellets.||In the mid and upper levels, this complex, messy and memorable holiday weather event occurred under pronounced southwesterly flow aloft on the downstream side of an expansive, large-scale trough centered over the western United States. On the smaller scale, forcing was provided by a lead shortwave disturbance ejecting out from the parent trough through western Nebraska into South Dakota.
