Short project description goes here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your machine.

### Installing

To get a local copy of the code, clone it using git:
bash git clone https://github.com/ehlenbergerjl/WindBreak.git

Or, you can do this directly in PyCharm or DataSpell:

1. In the Welcome screen, click on "Get from VCS".
2. In the Version Control window, paste the following URL: https://github.com/ehlenbergerjl/WindBreak.git
3. Choose the directory where you want the project to be on your local machine and click "Clone".

After the project has been cloned, PyCharm or DataSpell will prompt to open the project. Click "Yes" and the IDE will load the project for you.

Navigate to the project directory if neccesary:
cd <project-directory>

Run the setup script:
wb_setup.bat

This will create and activate the Conda environment `WindBreaks` and install all the necessary packages.
### Running the project

Now you can run the project using:
python python group2_main.py
